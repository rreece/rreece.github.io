We should remind ourselves, that independent of our debates,
nature is doing some things in some ways and not in others.

>   If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics
>   (works on religion and philosophy) let us ask this question,
>   does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?
>   No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of
>   fact or existence? No. Commit it then to the flames,
>   for it can be nothing but sophistry and illusion.

 -- David Hume, *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (1748)
