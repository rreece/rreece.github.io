title: "Scientific realism"
date: today
---


Can we claim to know anything about reality?
Is it a goal of science to describe reality?
Does science make any progress at describing reality?
This outline focuses on the issues of _**metaphysical**_ progress
from science, while the 
[Outline on the scientific method](scientific-method.html)
discusses the epistemological foundations and limitations of science.

This could have been called the outline of "Metaphysics" or
"The realism debate".


Metaphysics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

When one encounters the word "metaphysics", what is usually meant is one of the
three following ideas:

-   What *really* exists, or at least what exist literally beyond what we know
    in physics.  This is one of the oldest and fundamental branches in philosophy.
    In a naturalist sense, high-energy theoretical physics can be seen as
    examples of theoretical metaphysics at its best, ideas about about what
    there exists at a more fundamental level based on what we know at more
    pedestrian levels of experience.
-   A pejorative word, denoting ideas that are meaningless because they are
    claims beyond what is verifiable.  This was the view of the positivistists.
-   A loosely, if ill-defined, woo-woo word in which a mystic, guru, or metaphysician
    may claim to specialize.

Russell:

>   [T]he attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means of thought.

van Inwagen:

>   The word 'metaphysics' is derived from a collective title of the fourteen books by
>   Aristotle that we currently think of as making up Aristotle's *Metaphysics*.
>   Aristotle himself did not know the word. (He had four names for the branch of
>   philosophy that is the subject-matter of Metaphysics: 'first philosophy', 
>   'first science', 'wisdom', and 'theology'.) At least one hundred years after
>   Aristotle's death, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of Rhodes) 
>   titled those fourteen books "*Ta meta ta phusika*"---"the after the physicals" or 
>   "the ones after the physical ones"---the "physical ones" being the books contained
>   in what we now call Aristotle's *Physics*. The title was probably meant to warn
>   students of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt Metaphysics only after
>   they had mastered "the physical ones", the books about nature or the natural
>   world. [^vanInwagen2014]

Stealing from encyclopedia.com:

>   In medieval and modern philosophy "metaphysics" has also been taken to mean the study
>   of things transcending nature---that is, existing separately from nature and having
>   more intrinsic reality and value than the things of nature---giving *meta*
>   a philosophical meaning it did not have in classical Greek.
>   
>   Especially since Immanuel Kant metaphysics has often meant a priori speculation on
>   questions that cannot be answered by scientific observation and experiment.
>   Popularly, "metaphysics" has meant anything abstruse and highly theoretical---a common
>   eighteenth-century usage illustrated by David Hume's occasional use of metaphysical to
>   mean "excessively subtle". The term has also been popularly associated with the spiritual,
>   the religious, and even the occult. In modern philosophical usage metaphysics refers
>   generally to the field of philosophy dealing with questions about the kinds of things
>   there are and their modes of being. Its subject matter includes the concepts of existence,
>   thing, property, event; the distinctions between particulars and universals,
>   individuals and classes; the nature of relations, change, causation; and the nature of mind,
>   matter, space, and time.

Aquinas on truth:

>   Moreover, that there is truth is self-evident,
>   because whoever denies that there is truth concedes that there is truth,
>   for if there is no truth, then it is true that there is no truth.
>   But if something is true, then it follows that there is truth. [^Aquinas1485Part1]

[^RepublicVII514]: Plato, *Republic VII* 514--520, @Cooper_1997_Plato_Complete_works\, p. 1132--7.


### Early modern skepticism

-   Many philosophers in that Early Modern Period had threads of Idealism (wikipedia: reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core). *e.g.* George Berkeley, Kant, Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
-   Descartes' demon


### Modern skepticism

-   "Here is one hand" - Moore [^Moore1925]
-   Wittgenstein, L. (1969). *On Certainty*. [^Wittgenstein1969a]
-   The map and the territory

Korzybski:

>   A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. [^Korzybski1933p58]

Borges:

>   **On Exactitude in Science**
>
>   ... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

Instrumentalism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With realism and antirealism being one of the oldest dichotomies of positions
in philosophy, a way of classifying the tension in more recent philosophy is
between *instrumentalism* and *scientific realism*, each with many varieties.
First let's look at instrumentalism.

### First pass

Theoretical concepts may have use in predicting observations,
but we have no ontological commitments to them.

-   Antirealist

See also:

-   [Positivism](#positivism)
-   [Pragmatism](#pragmatism)


### History

-   Pierre Duhem (1861-1916)
    -   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism): "Initially a novel perspective introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today." [^Torretti1999]
-   Percy Williams Bridgman (1882-1961)
    -   Bridgman, P.W. (1927). *The Logic of Modern Physics*.
        -    operationalism: coining the term operational definition
-   Later Wittgenstein in *PI*. See [Postpositivism](#postpositivism), below.

[^Torretti1999]: @Torretti_1999_The_Philosophy_of_Physics\, p. 242--243.


### Discussion

-   Barrett [^Barrett2004]

Redhead:

>   There is an enormous gap between so-called analytic philosophy which broadly agrees
>   that there is something special about science and scientific method, and tries to
>   pin down exactly what it is, and the modern continental tradition which is deeply
>   suspicious of science and its claims to truth and certainty, and generally
>   espouses a cultural relativism that derives from Nietzsche and goes all the way
>   to the postmodern extremes of Derrida and his ilk. There is also the social
>   constructivism that sees scientific facts as mere 'social constructions' and is a
>   direct offshoot of the continental relativism. But the analytic tradition itself
>   divides sharply between instrumentalism and realism, the former seeing theories
>   in physics as mathematical 'black boxes' linking empirical input with empirical
>   output, while the latter seeks to go behind the purely observational data, and
>   reveal something at least of the hidden 'theoretical' processes that lie behind
>   and explain the observational regularities. [^Redhead1999p34]

Scientific realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### First pass

Some attempts at definitions:

Science makes real progress in describing real features of the world.

Chakravartty:

>   To a very rough, first approximation, realism is the view that our best scientific theories
>   correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world. [^Chakravartty2007]

Chakravartty:

>   Scientific realism is a positive epistemic attitude towards the content of our
>   best theories and models, recommending belief in both observable and unobservable
>   aspects of the world described by the sciences. [^Chakravartty2017]

-   Helmholtz
-   Boyd
-   Sellars
-   Chakravartty
-   Psillos, S. (1999). *Scientific Realism: How science tracks truth*. [^Psillos1999]
-   Sankey

Helmholtz:

>   What Helmholtz then asserted, in his classic essay “On the Facts of Perception,” is that the inference to a hypostasized reality lying behind the appearances goes beyond what is warranted by the lawfulness obtaining among appearances. Indeed, all localizations of objects in space are really nothing more than the discovery of the lawfulness of the connections obtaining among our motions and our perceptions. The difference between what is genuinely perceived and its realistic interpretation is just the difference between the regularities in our perceptions and the hypothesis of enduring, substantial sources of the perceived regularities (Helmholtz 1977, 138–140). [^Oberdan2013]

Sankey:

>   Correspondence theories which treat truth as a relation between language
>   and reality are the only theories of truth compatible with realism. [^Sankey2001]

>   The realist aim for science is to discover the truth, or the approximate truth,
>   or the truth with some associated degree of error, about not only the observable
>   aspects of the world but also its unobservable aspects. Associated with this is the
>   elimination of error, or its minimization, while truth is maximized.
>   While the pursuit of science may increase our ability to control the environment,
>   or to predict observable phenomena, these are secondary pursuits compared with
>   the realist's aim of acquiring (approximately) true theories. [^Sankey2007p338]

### Challenges to scientific realism

The primary dichotomy of positions is between forms of scientific realism and instrumentalism.

Positivism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   antirealist
-   nominalism

Positivism is a philosophy of science and epistemology that roughly defends a
qualified empiricism, that the scientific method is the only route to knowledge,
and that all statements that cannot be empirically verified are meaningless.
Positivism is strongly eliminative about metaphysics and claims that many
metaphysical questions and positions are not open or false, but meaningless
because of their lack of attachment to empirically demonstrable things or effects.

Google:

>   Logical positivism: a form of positivism, developed by members of the
>   Vienna Circle, that considers that the only meaningful philosophical
>   problems are those that can be solved by logical analysis.

Chakravartty:

>   According to the best known, traditional form of instrumentalism, terms
>   for unobservables have no meaning all by themselves; construed literally,
>   statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity
>   (cf. a more recent proposal in Rowbottom 2011). The most influential
>   advocates of this view were the logical empiricists (or logical positivists),
>   including Carnap and Hempel, famously associated with the Vienna Circle
>   group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors
>   elsewhere. In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might
>   otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they
>   adopted a non-literal semantics according to which these terms acquire
>   meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example,
>   "electron" might mean "white streak in a cloud chamber"), or with
>   demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called "operationalism").
>   Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately
>   (in large measure) to the demise of logical empiricism and the growth of
>   realism. The contrast here is not merely in semantics and epistemology: a
>   number of logical empiricists also held the neo-Kantian view that
>   ontological questions "external" to the frameworks for knowledge
>   represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is
>   made solely on pragmatic grounds), thereby rejecting the metaphysical
>   dimension of realism (as in Carnap 1950). [^Chakravartty2017]

This means that positivism is generally seen to imply antirealist views of
science and mathematics, preferring as Carnap says in
"Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology":

>   Empiricists are in general rather suspicious with respect to any kind of abstract 
>   entities like properties, classes, relations, numbers, propositions, etc. 
>   They usually feel much more in sympathy with nominalists than with realists (in the medieval sense).
>   As far as possible they try to avoid any reference to abstract entities and to 
>   restrict themselves to what is sometimes called a nominalistic language, i.e.,
>   one not containing such references. [^Carnap1950p1]

Positivists have instrumentalist (antirealist) views about the models science
produces, given that they are constructed from abstractions and involve the
epistemological limitations of induction and theory change. As a qualified sort
of empiricism that supports the primacy of the scientific method, positivism
is sometimes equated with scientism (often derogatorily) if one takes it to
claim that science is the only way to attain knowledge.

Russell:

>   Modern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume 
>   by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical 
>   technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite 
>   answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has 
>   the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of 
>   being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent
>   at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, 
>   resemble those of science. [^Russell1946p742]

Schlick:

>   If we say, as was frequently said of old, that metaphysics is the theory
>   of "true being", of "reality in itself", of "transcendent being" this
>   obviously implies a (contradictory), spurious, lesser, apparent
>   being; as has indeed been assumed by all metaphysicians since the time
>   of Plato and the Eleatics. This apparent being is the realm of
>   "appearances", and while the true transcendent reality is to be reached
>   only with difficulty, by the efforts of the metaphysician, the special
>   sciences have to do exclusively with appearances which are perfectly
>   accessible to them. The contrast in cognizability of these two "modes
>   of being" is then explained by the fact that the appearances are
>   immediately known, "given", to us, while metaphysical reality must be
>   inferred from them in some roundabout manner. And thus we seem
>   to arrive at a fundemental concept of the positivists, for they always
>   speak of the "given", and usually formulate their fundamental principle
>   in the proposition that the philosopher as well as the scientist must
>   always remain within the given, that to go beyond it, as the metaphysician
>   attempts, is impossible or senseless. [^Schlick1948p479]

In a more general sense, positivism is aligned with naturalism, the
meta-philosophy that roughly says that science should inform and bootstrap
our philosophical claims. Naturalists, having a more broadly aligned and
various support for science, may not have such exclusive views of
epistemology or such eliminative views of metaphysics. Many naturalists are
instead realists about science, math, and/or ethics, for example following
a version of structural realism about the discoveries from science, capturing
and constraining real structures in nature.

Creath:

>   contemporary philosophers promote a kind of naturalism, and by so doing
>   they follow both the precept and the example of the logical
>   empiricists. [^Creath2017a]

>   and the constant sequences which unite them as antecedent and consequent,

>   or final, are unknown and inscrutable to us. [^Mill1865Part1]

Comte on the unknowability of the composition of stars:

>   conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their
>   motions, we shall never be able by any means to study their chemical composition

>   envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive

manifesto:

>   "What can be said at all, can be said clearly" (Wittgenstein) [^Hahn1973Sec1_2]

Wittgenstein explaining the point of the *Tractatus* in a letter to Russell:

>   The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (*gesagt*) by
>   propositions---i.e. by language (and, which comes to the same thing,
>   what can be *thought*) and what can not be expressed by propositions,
>   but only shown (*gezeigt*); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem
>   of philosophy. [^Anscombe1959p161]

Gaskin:

>   The realism implicit in the idea of answerability to the world contrasts
>   with a pragmatist approach, such as that advocated by Richard Rorty, according
>   to which subjects are answerable in judgement not to the world, but to other
>   judging subjects. [^Gaskin2009p53]

#### Neurath's boat

-   Coherentism
-   Anti-foundationalism
-   Duhem-Quine thesis

Neurath:

>   Duhem has shown with special emphasis that every statement about any
>   happening is saturated with hypotheses of all sorts and that these in
>   the end are derived from our whole world-view. We are like sailors who
>   on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start
>   afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at
>   once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In
>   this way, by using the old beams and driftwood, the ship can be shaped
>   entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction. [^Neurath1973p199]

and

>   There is no way to establish fully secured, neat protocol statements as
>   starting points of the sciences. There is no *tabula rasa*. We are like
>   sailors who have to rebuild their ship on the open sea, without ever being
>   able to dismantle it in dry-dock and reconstruct it from the best components.
>   Only metaphysics can disappear without trace. Imprecise 'verbal clusters'
>   ['*Ballungen*'] are somehow always part of the ship. If imprecision is
>   diminished at one place, it may well re-appear at another place to a
>   stronger degree. [^Neurath1933p92]

Quine:

>   Neurath has likened science to a boat which, if we are to rebuild it, we
>   must rebuild plank by plank while staying afloat in it. The philosopher
>   and the scientist are in the same boat. If we improve our understanding
>   of ordinary talk of physical things, it will not be by reducing that talk
>   to a more familiar idiom; there is none. It will be by clarifying the
>   connections, causal or otherwise, between ordinary talk of physical things
>   and various further matters which in turn we grasp with help of ordinary
>   talk of physical things. [^Quine1960p3]

#### Reichenbach

On logical empiricism and Reichenbach at UCLA:

>   Part of the movement's legacy lies in contemporary philosophy of science.
>   In the US nearly all philosophers of science can trace their academic
>   lineages to Reichenbach. Most were either his students or students of his
>   students and so on. His scientific realism inspired a generation of
>   philosophers, even those clearly outside the movement. Even the reaction
>   against various forms of realism that have appeared in recent decades have
>   roots in the logical empiricist movement. Moreover, philosophers of science
>   are expected to know a great deal of the science about which they
>   philosophize and to be cautious in telling practicing scientists what
>   concepts they may or may not use. In these respects and others contemporary
>   philosophers promote a kind of naturalism, and by so doing they follow
>   both the precept and the example of the logical empiricists. [^Creath2017d]

and

>   Among his many students were Hempel, Putnam, and W. Salmon, and so almost
>   all philosophy of science in the US can trace its academic lineage to
>   Reichenbach. Though interested in social and educational reform, he worked
>   primarily in philosophy of physics. He developed and defended a frequency
>   theory of probability, and emphasized both scientific realism and the
>   importance of causality and causal laws. [^Creath2017e]

### Attack on the analytic/synthetic distinction

>   Among the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing
>   were Quine's attack on the analytic/synthetic distinction, which was
>   generally taken to undermine Carnap's distinction between existence
>   questions internal to a framework and those external to
>   it. [^WikipediaMetaphysics]

-   Carnap's internal vs external questions, (ESO), again
-   Quine, W.V.O. (1951). Two dogmas of empiricism.  [^Quine1951b]
    1.  Analytic/synthetic distinction
    2.  Reductionism (verification theory of meaning)

Quine on our pale gray lore:

>   The lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences. In our hands it develops
>   and changes, through more or less arbitrary and deliberate revisions and
>   additions of our own, more or less directly occasioned by the continuing
>   stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale grey lore, black with fact and
>   white with convention. But I have found no substantial reasons for
>   concluding that there are any quite black threads in it, or any white
>   ones. [^Quine1960bp374]

Carnap remained optimistic about his views of analyticity, intension,
and meaning:

>   Bar-Hillel points out that the semantical theory of meaning developed
>   recently by logicians is free of these drawbacks. He appeals to the
>   linguists to construct in an analogous way the theory of meaning needed
>   in their empirical investigations. The present paper indicates the
>   possibility of such a construction. The fact that the concept of
>   intension can be applied even to a robot shows that it does not have
>   the psychologistic character of the traditional concept of meaning. [^Carnap1955p46]

Feigl:

>   The revolt against the dualism of the analytic and the synthetic rests
>   on a confusion of the logical analysis of (artificially fixed) languages
>   with the historical investigation of (growing, shifting natural)
>   languages. [^Feigl1956p7]

-   Grice, H.P. & Strawson, P.F. (1956). In defense of a dogma. [^Grice1956]
-   Quine's critique is decribed well in Stalnaker, R.C. (2003). *Ways a World Might Be*. [^Stalnaker2003p1]

### Attack on the verification theory of meaning

-   Quine, W.V.O. (1960). *Word and Object*. [^Quine1960a]
    -   Inscrutability of reference
    -   Indeterminacy of translation
-   Ruja, H. (1961). The present status of the verifiability criterion. [^Ruja1961]

-   Putnam, H. (1975). The meaning of "meaning". [^Putnam1975MOM]

Nietzsche:

>   Against positivism, which would stand by the position "There are only facts",
>   I would say: no, there are precisely no facts, only interpretations.
>   We can establish no fact "in itself": it is perhaps nonsense to want
>   such a thing. You say "Everything is subjective": but that is already
>   an interpretation, the "subject" is not anything given, but something
>   invented and added, something stuck behind... To the extent that
>   the word "knowledge" [*Erkenntnis*] has any sense, the world is knowable:
>   but it is interpretable differently, it has no sense behind it, but
>   innumerable senses, "perspectivism". It is our needs that interpret the
>   world: our drives and their to and fro. Every drive is a kind of domination,
>   every one has its perspective, which it would force on all other drives as
>   a norm. [^NietzscheNotebook7]


Putnam:

>   If language is a tool, it is a tool like an ocean liner, which requires
>   many people cooperating (and participating in a complex division of labor)
>   to use. What gives one's words the particular meanings they have is not
>   just the state of one's brain, but the relations one has to both one's
>   non-human environment and to other speakers. [^Putnam1997p196]

### The "death" of positivism

-   Anti-positivism, Kuhn, Popper
-   post-structuralism, postmodernism (continental)
-   Hempel, C.G. (1950). Problems and changes in the empiricist criterion of meaning. [^Hemple1950]
-   In 1967 John Passmore reported that: "Logical positivism, then,
    is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes." [^Passmore1967]
-   A.J. Ayer (1910-1989)

-   Edmonds, D. (2020). *The Murder of Professor Schlick: The Rise and Fall of the Vienna Circle*. [^Edmonds2020b]

Clarke & Primo:

>   Following Suppe (2000), we date the demise of logical positivism to
>   March 26, 1969---opening night of the Illinois Symposium on the
>   Structure of Scientific Theories. [^Clarke2004]

Ayer:

>   The most important defect was that nearly all of it was false. [^Ayer1978]

Bunge:

>   Logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism
>   of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, John Stuart Mill, and Ernst Mach. It
>   was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals---neo-Thomisism,
>   neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and
>   existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful
>   account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it
>   remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics,
>   overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and
>   denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it
>   has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and
>   has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963),
>   logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists.
>   Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social
>   science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild
>   speculation. [^Bunge1996p317]

### Lasting influence of positivism

Much ado is made about positivism being "dead", but its influence is still
promenent in philosophy, sociology, and public administration.

Friedman:

>   Carnap's influence, in particular, also extended much further: to the
>   widespread application of logical and mathematical methods to philosophical
>   problems more generally, especially in semantics and the philosophy of
>   language. Indeed, as is well known, the ideas of the logical positivists
>   exerted a very substantial influence well beyond the boundaries of
>   professional philosophy, particularly in psychology and the social sciences.
>   It is not too much to say, therefore, that twentieth-century intellectual life
>   would be simply uncrecognizable without the deep and pervasive current of
>   logical positivist thought. [^Friedman1999pxii]

Quine:

>   Carnap is a towering figure. I see him as the dominant figure in philosophy
>   from the 1930's onward, as Russell had been in the decades before. [^Quine1970pxxii]

and

>   Carnap was my greatest teacher...
>   I was very much his disciple for six years. In later years his views
>   went on evolving and so did mine, in divergent ways. But even where we
>   disagreed he was still setting the theme; the line of my thought was largely
>   determined by problems that I felt his position presented. [^Quine1970pxxiii]

Popper:

>   Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories---the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences---are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.) Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories. [^Popper1963pX]

Bunge:

>   As is well known, conceptual objects have been the undoing of
>   traditional empiricism as well as of vulgar materialism, for they are
>   neither distillates of ordinary experiences nor material objects or
>   properties thereof. To be sure, the empiricist may claim that there
>   are no conceptual objects aside from mental events. But he cannot
>   explain how different minds can grasp the same conceptual objects
>   and why psychology is incapable of accounting for the logical,
>   mathematicaland semantical properties of constructs. And the
>   vulgar materialist (nominalist) will likewise discard conceptual
>   objects and speak instead of linguistic objects---e.g. of terms instead
>   of concepts and of sentences instead of propositions. But he is unable
>   to explain the conceptual invariants of linguistic transformations
>   (e.g. translations) as well as the fact that linguistics presupposes
>   logic and semantics rather than the other way round. Therefore we
>   cannot accept either the empiricist or the nominalist reduction
>   (elimination) of conceptual objects any more than we can admit the
>   idealist claim that they are ideal beings with an autonomous existence.

Sankey:

>   *The Causal-Theoretic Reply to Incommensurability*

>   Assuming the causal theory of reference, one might reply to the

>   sense of 'sense', of scientific terms may well vary in the course of
>   theoretical change. However, it does not follow that reference must also
>   vary as a result of such change of meaning. For reference is not

>   terms with initial baptisms at which their reference was fixed. So
>   reference does not vary with the changes of descriptive content which
>   occur during theoretical change. Hence, reference is held constant across

Boghossian:

>   interest--whether, given a person's evidence, the epistemic facts always
>   dictate a *unique* answer to the question what is to be believed or whether
>   there are cases in which they permit some rational disagreement. So there is
>   a question about the extent of the epistemic objectivism to which we are

Structural realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Science has identified real patterns, relationships, and structures
(at least within a regime) in nature.

-   Realist
-   [Inverse problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem)
    -   Wikipedia: "Inverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in science and mathematics because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe."


### History

-   Plato's injunction in the *Phaedrus* to carve nature at its joints 
-   Early Wittgenstein: picture theory of language/meaning
-   Strucuturalism more generally and structural anthropology: Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss
-   Henri Poincar&eacute;
-   Grover Maxwell coined "structural realism" [^Maxwell1968]
-   Russell [^Russell1992pX]
-   Nozick, R. (2001). *Invariances*. [^Nozick2001]

Plato's *Phaedrus*:

>   Socrates: ... [There are] two kinds of things the nature of which it would be
>   quite wonderful to grasp by means of a systematic art.
>
>   Phaedrus: Which things?
>   
>   Socrates: The first consists in seeing together things that are scattered
>   about everywhere and collecting them into one kind, so that by defining
>   each thing we can make clear the subject of any instruction we wish to
>   give. Just so with our discussion on love: Whether its definition was or
>   was not correct, at least it allowed the speach to proceed clearly and
>   consistently with itself.
>   
>   Phaedrus: And what is the other thing you are talking about, Socrates?
>   
>   Socrates: This, in turn, is to be able to cut up each kind according to
>   its species along its natural joints, and to try not to splinter any part, as
>   a bad butcher might do. [^Phaedrus265d]

Psillos:

>   Helmholtz-Weyl Principle (HW): Different effects (i.e. percepts) imply different
>   causes (i.e. stimuli/physical objects). [^HWPrinciple]

Poincar&eacute;:

>   [W]hat is objective must be common to many minds and consequently transmissible from one to the other. ...
>   [P]ure quality ... is intransmissible... . But it is not the same with relations...
>   From this point of view, what is objective is ... only pure relation. [^Poincare1913p347]

Critical realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Critical realists believe that there are unobservable events which cause the
observable ones; as such, the social world can be understood only if people
understand the structures that generate such unobservable events.

-   Freely emphasizes the political implications of scientific realism.

Active realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   Hasok Chang
    -   pluralist
    -   defends phlogiston theory of combustion


My thoughts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, I plan to summarize my thoughts after finishing the analysis of
several sources below.

Ways to phrase the issue:

-   Does your worldview have commitments to ontologies claimed to be part of reality?
-   Is the goal of science to describe reality?  Does science make any progress at that?

Misc.:

-   Relation to naturalism and mathematical realism.
-   We should remind ourselves that independent of our debate, the world is doing
    something in certain ways and not in others.

Questions:

-   Is there a position that requires *any* element of a good scientific theory to
    be interpretable?  What would that mean?
-   Maybe scientism is really the same thing positivism re-branded;
    similarly, naturalism is empiricism re-branded.

### Carnap, R. (1950). Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology.

-   @Carnap_1950_Empiricism_semantics_and_ontology

#### 1. The problem of abstract entities

-   Empiricists tend to prefer to restrict themselves to
    *nominalistic language* -- without containing references to abstract entities.
-   Formalists view mathematics as a mechanistic calculus without interpretation,
    but physics seems to lend its own interpretation.

>   In physics it is more difficult to shun the suspected entities because the language
>   of physics serves for the communication of reports and predictions and hence
>   cannot be taken as a mere calculus.

-   A physicist may declare some parts of a theory as uninterpretable.
-   Carnap says his purpose is to clarify that *empiricists can accept a
    language referring to abstract entities without embracing platonic ontologies*.

#### 2. Linguistic frameworks

-   Carnap defines *linguistic frameworks*, *internal* vs *external* questions
    (internal to the framework or about the metaphysical world),
    and the *world of things*.

>   To recognize something as a real thing or event means to succeed in
>   incorporating it into the system of things at a particular space-time
>   position so that it fits together with the other things as real,
>   according to the rules of the framework.

-   Carnap distinguishes that only the philosopher
    (not the man on the street nor the scientist)
    asks the external questions about reality outside the linguistic framework.
-   Carnap goes on about what it means to accept the *thing language*.
    The system can be constructed by introducing new language expressions
    (as a sequence of `typedef`s, as he seems to mean).

#### 3. What does acceptance of a kind of entities mean?

#### 4. Abstract entities in semantics

#### 5. Conclusion

#### My thoughts

-   Sometimes I feel like Carnap repeats his theses though as if that helps support them.
    He says over and over that accepting a thing in a language is practical matter,
    not a theoretical/metaphysical one, which I agree with to a degree.
    But then that leaves us on the edge of a lot of semantic cliffs,
    saying "but what do our abstract entities mean?", or rather,
    "what does their scientific success mean?".
-   In the end, my impression is that I'm still not satisfied with nominalism.
    I feel like the road to addressing Carnap, the issues he should have acknowledged,
    is that some of our abstract classes are *super fucking natural*.
    The success of some instances of our abstract internal languages
    should lead one, through the same methods of scientific inference that we do
    within the internal language,
    to do *abduction to natural kinds* in the external world.
    To deny the likely success of that abduction is to plead that there is a conspiracy.
-   The map is not the territory (Jorge Luis Borges).
