What is philosophy of science?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Philosophy of science may sound like a rather dry and esoteric topic,
but its concerns have implications as radical as delineating
*how we arrive at knowledge* and
*how much if anything can be known about reality*.
These issues are part of broader divisions in philosophy:
epistemology (how do we know?) and metaphysics (what exists?), respectively.
In our modern information age,
the evident power of science to elevate our awareness and bring us new
technological capabilities
underscores the relevance of a philosophical understanding of science.

Philosophy of science asks: what is science?
Do the diverse inquiries called science
have an underlying, universal, scientific method, and if so, what is it?
How can we tell science from pseudoscience?
Is science a way of producing knowledge, and if so, are there other
ways of knowing?
What should we say of the products of science,
and in particular, does science make any progress at
revealing or approximating truth?
Where has science taken us and where is it going?


What is naturalism?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Naturalism* is an attitude about how philosophy should be done (a meta-philosophy)
and about how philosophy relates to science.
A very diverse set of thinkers are often characterized as naturalists or aligned
with naturalism, at the expense of much clarity in the term, but naturalism
generally consists of varying degrees of either or both:

1.  *epistemological naturalism* - an epistemic respect for science;
    a methodological commitment to
    the [scientific method](http://rreece.github.io/outline-of-philosophy/scientific-method.html)
    of justifying empirical claims as a route to knowledge,
    if not the chief or perhaps (with a sufficiently broad definition)
    the only route to knowledge.
    Science should be guiding in what we claim to know.
2.  *ontological naturalism* - has a variety of claims and interpretations,
    but they center on the premise that if we have any claim to what is,
    it better be informed by and consistent with science.
    It often involves a skepticism of *a priori* metaphysics,
    and sometimes has further qualified ontological commitments to the products of science,
    which concerns the debate of [scientific realism](http://rreece.github.io/outline-of-philosophy/scientific-realism.html).
    Another claim associated with ontological naturalism and closely
    related to epistemological naturalism is a rejection of ontologies to which we
    do not have demonstrable access *i.e.* supernatural entities,
    which can be seen as a claim to a type of monism as opposed to dualism about ontology.
    At the least, it is a claim that science should be guiding in what we claim there is.

At its simplest, perhaps [naturalism](http://rreece.github.io/outline-of-philosophy/naturalism.html)
can be summarized as a rejection of *a priori* speculation
and a support for a science-first philosophy,
a kind of refined and qualified empiricism.
Roughly, naturalism is an endorsement that science should bootstrap philosophy.
It does not mean that science comes prior to the philosophy of the scientific method itself,
but once science is actively producing knowledge,
naturalism says that the way we should think about the world
and the new questions we ask about it should be informed by science.

TODO:

-   expand this before it is immediately misunderstood.
-   David Hume, Hans Reichenbach, W.V.O. Quine, Wilfrid Sellars.
-   Philosophy is continuous with science (Quine).
-   Philosophy is a nursery for budding sciences.


Why should I care?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO.

We live in a time where science has clear leverage on shaping our future,
while at the same time,
basic disagreements about the nature of science and
its implications for a worldview
are central to many of our cultural and politcal divisions.

Who do I want to reach with this argument?

-   Anyone interested in the engagement of science and philosophy.
-   Science skeptics and anti-naturalists of one form or another that see science
    as just one of many competing claims to knowledge,
    with or without the capability of describing reality.
-   Allies in illucidating the demarcation of what science is,
    and what sorts of claims it justifies.
-   TODO: Can this be accessible and interesting to both academic and lay audiences?
