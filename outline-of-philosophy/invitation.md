What is philosophy of science?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Philosophy of science may sound like a rather dry and esoteric topic,
but its concerns have implications as radical as delineating
*how we arrive at knowledge* and
*how much if anything can be known about reality*.
These issues are part of the broader divisions in philosophy:
epistemology (how do we know?) and metaphysics (what exists?), respectively.
In our modern information age,
the evident power of science to elevate our awareness and bring us new
technological capabilities
underscores the relevance of a philosophical understanding of science.
Philosophy of science asks: what is science?
If the diverse inquiries called science
have an underlying, universal, scientific method, and if so, what is it?
How can we tell science from pseudoscience?
Is science a way of producing knowledge, and if so, are there other
ways of knowing?
It asks: what should we say of the products of science,
and in particular, does science make any progress at
revealing or approximating truth?
Where has science taken us and where is it going?


What is naturalism?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Naturalism* is an attitude about how philosophy should be done (a meta-philosophy)
and about how philosophy relates to science.
A very diverse set of thinkers are often characterized as naturalists or aligned
with naturalism, at the expense of much clarity in the term, but naturalism
generally consists of varying degrees of either or both:

1.  *epistemological naturalism* - An epistemic respect for science; a methodological commitment that
    the scientific method of justifying empirical claims is a route to knowledge,
    if not the chief or only route to knowledge.
    Science should be guiding in what we claim to know.
2.  *ontological naturalism* - Skepticism of *a priori* metaphysics;
    possibly an ontological commitment to the products of science.
    TODO: a rejection of causaly supernatural; a support of monism;
    possibly a support for a kind of scientific realism.
    Science should be guiding in what we claim there is.

TODO: rejection of *a priori* speculation and a support for a science-first philosophy.
One might say that naturalism is basically the position that science should bootstrap philosophy.

TODO: Hume, Reichenbach, Quine.
