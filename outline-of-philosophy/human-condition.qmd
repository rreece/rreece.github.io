title: "The human condition"
date: today
---


What are we? What is the human condition?
What are our orientations, our worldviews?

This outline discusses human (pre)history, anthropology, religion,
comparitive studies, biology, psychology, and practical philosophy.

Here, I am interested in collecting what various traditions say we are as
humans.


Human history

![Map of migrations of early homo sapiens ([ancient.eu](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1070/early-human-migration/), 2017).](img/early-human-migration.png){#fig-early-human-migration}

>   The early human migrations
>   in the Lower Paleolithic saw Homo erectus spread across Eurasia 1.8 million
>   years ago. The controlled use of fire first occurred 800,000 years ago in the
>   Middle Paleolithic. 250,000 years ago, Homo sapiens (modern humans) emerged
>   in Africa. 60--70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along
>   a coastal route to South and Southeast Asia and reached Australia.
>   50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from Asia to the Near East.
>   Europe was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago.
>   Humans migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago in the Upper
>   Paleolithic. [^WikiAncientHistory]

>   Unlike our species, Neanderthals probably did not need to be good
>   long-distance runners. Homo sapiens lived on hot, dry African grasslands,
>   where they hunted by pursuing large animals over long distances until they
>   collapsed from heat exhaustion. In the cooler regions occupied by
>   Neanderthals, heat exhaustion would not be a problem, so running long
>   distances would not have helped them hunt. Instead, they took advantage
>   of their landscape and ambushed prey. [^Marshall2011]

Feynman:

>   We are all sad when we think of the wondrous potentialities that human
>   beings seem to have and when we contrast these potentialities with the
>   small accomplishments that we have. Again and again people have thought
>   that we could do much better. People in the past had, in the nightmare
>   of their times, dreams for the future, and we of their future have,
>   although many of those dreams have been surpassed, to a large extent
>   the same dreams. The hopes for the future today are in a great measure
>   the same as they were in the past. At some time people thought that the
>   potential that people had was not developed because everyone was
>   ignorant and that education was the solution to the problem, that if
>   all people were educated, we could perhaps all be Voltaire's. But it
>   turns out that falsehood and evil can be taught as easily as good.
>   Education is a great power, but it can work either way. I have heard it
>   said that the communication between nations should lead to an
>   understanding and thus a solution to the problem of developing the
>   potentialities of man. But the means of communication can be channeled
>   and choked. What is communicated can be lies as well as truth,
>   propaganda as well as real and valuable information. Communication is
>   a strong force, also, but either for good or evil. [^Feynman1998p31]

#### Criticism

McNutt:

>   The Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time,
>   and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus
>   and the period of the Judges, is a late literary construct that does not
>   relate to any period in actual history. [^McNutt1999]

Sperling, S.D. [Were the Jews Slaves in Egypt?](https://reformjudaism.org/were-jews-slaves-egypt):

>   In short, the biblical writers invented the idea that the Israelites lived
>   in Egypt in order to impel them to maintain their distinctiveness in Canaan.
>   And the story of servitude in Egypt is an allegory of servitude to Egypt.
>   Our ancestors, among others, did perform forced labor for Egyptian
>   taskmasters, but they were never slaves in Egypt.

Moore & Kelle:

>   The majority of current scholars believe that the historicity of the
>   Egyptian sojourn, exodus, and wilderness wandering that the Bible
>   remembers cannot be demonstrated by historical methods. [^Moore2011]

### Therav&amacr;da Buddhism

#### Introduction

-   [Therav&amacr;da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) is Pali for "The School of the Elders".
-   Therav&amacr;da Buddhism is the oldest existing branch of Buddhism, deriving from schools in Sri Lanka where much of the Pali Cannon was written.
-   In contrast to Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na and Vajray&amacr;na, Therav&amacr;da tends to be conservative
    in matters of doctrine and monastic discipline, with particular focus on being rational.
-   Therav&amacr;da rejects the authenticity of the Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na sutras and do not see them as reliable sources.
-   The primary goal for a Therav&amacr;dan Buddhist is to become an arhat/arahant,
    one who has achieved enlightenment (bodhi or nirvana/nibb&amacr;na).
-   Very roughly, today Therav&amacr;da Buddhism is dominately found in south-east Asia:
    Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia;
    whereas Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na is found in more northern Asia: China, Korea, Japan,
    Taiwan, Hong Kong, but also Vietnam (see [@fig-Buddhist-sects]).

### Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism

#### Introduction

-   [Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana)
-   Sanskrit: "The Great Vehicle"
-   Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today.
-   Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhists teach that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime, and this can be accomplished even by a layperson.
-   Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism has a lot of doctrinal diversity due to assimilating with Asian cultures, particularly in Tibet, China, and Japan.
-   In contrast with Therav&amacr;da, Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism has more focus on devotionals, ritual, aesthetics,
    and monastic hierarchy. Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism also has more of a tendency to deify Buddhas.
-   The primary goal for a Mah&amacr;y&amacr;nan Buddhist is to follow the bodhisattva path
    to full buddhahood (samyaksambuddhahood) but taking however many reincarnations it takes to teach
    others the path, bringing them in the Great Vehicle as well.
-   Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na, in a somewhat pejorative way, sometimes refer to Therav&amacr;da
    as [Hinay&amacr;na](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinayana), "small/deficient vehicle".

Stoicism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### History

-   [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) (began in the 3rd century BCE)
    -   A stoa is an ancient Greek public covered walkway. Stoicism originally got
        its name from being a philosophy discussed out in public.
-   [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) (c. 334-262 BCE)
    -   He was a wealthy merchant, who on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus,
        was shipwrecked. After surving he read Xenophon's *Memorabilia* about Socrates,
        and Zeno devoted himself to studying philosophy.
    -   He studied under the Cynic [Crates of Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crates_of_Thebes).
    -   Founder of the Stoic school of philosophy in Athens c. 300 BCE.
-   [Cleanthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes) (c. 330-230 BCE)
    -   Successor to Zeno of Citium as the second head the Stoic school in Athens.
-   [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus) (c. 279-206 BCE)
    -   Studied under Cleanthes and became the third head of the Stoic school in Athens.
-   [Seneca (the Younger)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger) (4 BCE - 65 CE)
    -   Roman statesman and later tutor to Emperor Nero
    -   *On the Shortness of Life* (*De Brevitate Vitae*) (49 CE) [^Seneca1997]
    -   *Letters from a Stoic* (65 CE)
        -   Collection of 124 letters addressed to [Lucilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilius_Junior)
    -   His influence over Nero declined with time, and in 65 CE
        he was forced to take his own life.
-   [Musonius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Musonius_Rufus) (c. 25-100 CE)
    -   Teacher of Epictetus
    -   Both men and women should study philosophy in pursuit of living a virtuous life.
-   [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) (c. 50-135 CE)
    -   Slave turned teacher
    -   *Discourses* (108 CE)
    -   *Handbook* (*Enchiridion*) (125 CE)
    -   Both of theses works were recorded by Epictetus' pupil [Arrian of Nicomedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrian) (c. 86/89-146/160 CE)
    -   Translation by Hard [^Epictetus2014]
-   [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) (121-180 CE)
    -   Last "good" emperor of Rome
    -   *Meditations* (170-180 CE)
    -   [Antonine Plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Plague) (165-180 CE)

#### Three historical phases of Stoicism

1.  Early Stoa from the founding of the school by Zeno to Antipater.
2.  Middle Stoa including Panaetius and Posidonius.
3.  Late Stoa including Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius.

No complete works survive from the first two phases of Stoicism.
Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.

### Theses

My personal summary of the most important Stoic theses:

#### 1. Dichotomy of control

-   Be mindful of what is and what is not in your control.
-   If something outside of your control causes you anxiety,
    you should try accept it and cast the anxiety aside.
-   We don't control what happens; we control how we respond.

>   What are we to do, then? To make the best of what lies within our
>   power, and deal with everything else as it comes.

--Epictetus, *Discourses*, 1.1.17

>   Materials are indifferent, but the use that one makes of them is by
>   no means indifferent. How, then, can one preserve firmness and
>   calmness of mind, and at the same time the attentiveness that saves
>   us from careless and thoughtless action? By following the example of
>   those who play at dice. The counters are indifferent, the dice are
>   indifferent. How can I know in what way the throw will fall? But to
>   be attentive and skilful in making use of whatever does fall, that
>   is now my task. And so likewise, my principal task in life is this:
>   to distinguish between things, and establish a division between them
>   and say, "External things are not within my power; choice is within
>   my power."

--Epictetus, *Discourses*, 2.5.1-4

#### 2. The obstacle is the way

-   If the cause of your anxiety is within your control,
    then the best (and really only good) solution is to face it.
-   We underestimate what stresses we can face.
-   In any circumstance, we have an opportunity to practice virtue,
    to be excellent.

>   The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our
>   acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the
>   way becomes the way.

--Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 5.20 (Ryan Holiday version)

#### 3. Reflection

-   Wise decisions come from patience and discernment.
-   Mindfulness, temperance, journaling, and focusing on what
    you can do will bring about the best solutions you can.

>   What is the first task for someone who is practicing philosophy?
>   To rid himself of presumption: for it is impossible for anyone to
>   set out to learn what he thinks he already knows.

--Epictetus, *Discourses*, 2.17.1

>   Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores,
>   mountains, and you also tend to desire such things very much.
>   But this is alltogether a mark of the most common sort of men,
>   for it is in your power to retire into yourself whenever you
>   shall choose. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom
>   from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul.

--Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 4.3

#### 4. Preferred indifferents

-   Health, wealth, and success are natural to prefer, but they
    are not necessary for living a good life.
-   We can have aspirations and goals, but on the onset we must
    be ready for failure. Much is out of our control.
-   Our goal should be to do the best we can, not to have the best outcome.

#### 5. Time is our most precious resource

-   TODO
-   Everything is impermanent. We are mortal.
    We will take nothing or no one with us beyond death.

>   Often think of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear,
>   both the things that are and the things which are produced.
>   For substance is like a river in a continual flow,
>   and the activities of things are in constant change,
>   and the causes of work in infinite varieties;
>   and there is hardly anything which stands still.
>   And consider this which is near to you,
>   this boundless abyss of the past and of the future in which all things
>   disappear. How then is he not a fool who is puffed up with such things
>   or plagued about them and makes himself miserable?
>   For they vex him only for a time, and indeed for a time that is short.

--Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 5.23

>   [T]he virtues for Epicurus are all purely instrumental goods---that is,
>   they are valuable solely for the sake of the happiness that they can bring
>   oneself, not for their own sake. Epicurus says that all of the virtues are
>   ultimately forms of prudence, of calculating what is in one's own best
>   interest. In this, Epicurus goes against the majority of Greek ethical
>   theorists, such as the Stoics, who identify happiness with virtue, and
>   Aristotle, who identifies happiness with a life of virtuous activity.
>   Epicurus thinks that natural science and philosophy itself also are
>   instrumental goods. Natural science is needed in order to give mechanistic
>   explanations of natural phenomena and thus dispel the fear of the gods,
>   while philosophy helps to show us the natural limits of our desires and
>   to dispel the fear of death. [^OKeefe2001]

first to propound an expressive theory of poetry, valorising expression over
description or imitation:

>   If the arguments, used in this essay, have any weight, it will appear,
>   that the finest parts of poetry, musick, and painting, are expressive of
>   the passions...the inferior parts of them are descriptive of natural

>   does not know, rather than if we believe that it is not possible
>   to find out what we do not know and that we must not look for
>   it. [^Meno86c]

Hume:

>   There is a great difference between historical facts and speculative opinions;
>   nor is the knowledge of the one propagated in the same manner with that of the
>   other. An historical fact, while it passes by oral tradition from eye-witnesses
>   and contemporaries, is disguised in every successive narration, and may at last
>   retain but very small, if any, resemblance of the original truth, on which it
>   was founded. The frail memories of men, their love of exaggeration, their
>   supine carelessness; these principles, if not corrected by books and writing,
>   soon pervert the account of historical events; where argument or reasoning has
>   little or no place, nor can ever recal the truth, which has once escaped those
>   narrations. [^HumeNHRpart1]

### Religion as a natural phenomena

_Anthropology_

-   Xenophanes

Xenophanes:

>   But if cattle or lions had hands, so as to paint with their hands and
>   produce works of art as men do, they would paint their gods and give
>   them bodies in form like their own---horses like horses, cattle like cattle. [^XenophanesB15]

>   Ethiopians make their gods black and snub-nosed;
>   Thracians that theirs red-haired and with blue eyes;
>   so also they conceive the spirits of the gods to be like themselves. [^XenophanesB16]

-   Hume, D. (1757). *The Natural History of Religion*.

Hume:

>   Survey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles, which have,
>   in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are
>   any thing but sick men's dreams. Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome
>   whimsies of monkeys in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical
>   assertions of a being who dignifies himself with the name of rational. [^HumeNHRp184]

-   Miller, A. (1949). *Death of a Salesman*. (a play)

From "Citizenship in a Republic" speech by Theodore Roosevelt in 1910:

>   It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
>   strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
>   better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
>   whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
>   who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
>   without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the
>   deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends
>   himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph
>   of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
>   while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold
>   and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. [^Roosevelt1910]

Cormac McCarthy:

>   Only now is the child finally divested of all that he has been.
>   His origins are become remote as is his destiny and not again in
>   all the world's turning will there be terrains so wild and
>   barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to
>   man's will or whether his own heart is not another kind of
>   clay. [^McCarthy1985p4]

Carl Sagan discussing Nietzsche:

>   In *The Genealogy of Morals*, Friedrich Nietzsche, as so many before and
>   after, decries the "unbroken progress in the self-belittling of man"
>   brought about by the scientific revolution. Nietzsche mourns the loss of
>   "man's belief in his dignity, his uniqueness, his irreplaceability in the
>   scheme of existence". For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it
>   really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.
>   Which attitude is better geared for our long-term survival? Which gives us
>   more leverage on our future? And if our naive self-confidence is a little
>   undermined in the process, is that altogether such a loss? Is there not
>   cause to welcome it as a maturing and character-building experience? [^Sagan1996p16]
