Naturalism
================================================================================

Naturalism is a unifying view of philosophy and science.
It is an attitude about how philosophy should be done (a meta-philosophy)
and about how philosophy relates to science.
Regardless of how one views the realism debate
(discussed in the [previous outline](scientific-realism.html)),
naturalism shows a provocative, unifying way of viewing the projects of
philosophy and science.

### What is naturalism?

Maddy defines naturalism:

>   These days, as more and more philosophers count themselves as naturalists,
>   the term has come to mark little more than a vague science-friendliness.
>   To qualify as unnaturalistic, a contemporary thinker has to insist,
>   for example, that epistemology is an a priori discipline with nothing to
>   learn from empirical psychology or that metaphysical intuitions show
>   quantum mechanics to be false.  [^Maddy-2007-1]

>   So our inquirer will continue her investigation of the world in her familiar
>   ways, despite her encounter with Descartes and his meditator. She will ask
>   traditionally philosophical questions about what there is and how we know it,
>   just as they do, but she will take perception as a mostly reliable guide to
>   the existence of medium-sized physical objects, she will consult her
>   astronomical observations and theories to weigh the existence of black holes,
>   and she will treat questions of knowledge as involving the relations between
>   the world---as she understands it in her physics, chemistry, optics, geology,
>   and so on---and human beings---as she understands them in her physiology,
>   cognitive science, neuroscience, linguistics, and so on.
>   While Descartes's meditator begins by rejecting science and common sense in
>   the hope of founding them more firmly by philosophical means, our inquirer
>   proceeds scientifically and attempts to answer even philosophical questions
>   by appeal to its resources. For Descartes's meditator, philosophy comes
>   first; for our inquirer, it comes second---hence 'Second Philosophy'
>   as opposed to 'First'. Our Character now has a name: she is the
>   Second Philosopher.  [^Maddy-2007-2]

Jacobs:

>   Naturalism is an approach to philosophical problems that interprets them as
>   tractable through the methods of the empirical sciences or at least, without
>   a distinctively a priori project of theorizing.  [^Jacobs2002]

Naturalism could be defined as a support for philosophy that is filtered for
plausibility given the information from science[^Ladyman2007].
See the outline on the [science method](scientific-method.html#is-there-a-universal-scientific-method).

>   There is an enormous gap between so-called analytic philosophy which broadly agrees
>   that there is something special about science and scientific method, and tries to
>   pin down exactly what it is, and the modern continental tradition which is deeply
>   suspicious of science and its claims to truth and certainty, and generally
>   espouses a cultural relativism that derives from Nietzsche and goes all the way
>   to the postmodern extremes of Derrida and his ilk. There is also the social
>   constructivism that sees scientific facts as mere 'social constructions' and is a
>   direct offshoot of the continental relativism. But the analytic tradition itself
>   divides sharply between instrumentalism and realism, the former seeing theories
>   in physics as mathematical 'black boxes' linking empirical input with empirical
>   output, while the latter seeks to go behind the purely observational data, and
>   reveal something at least of the hidden 'theoretical' processes that lie behind
>   and explain the observational regularities. [^Redhead1999p34]

[^Leibniz-De-Arte-Combinatoria]: Leibniz has similar quotes in several works.
    This quote is taken from a translation of his first book, *Dissertatio de arte combinatoria*,
    written in 1666 [@Leibniz_1989_Dissertatio_de_Arte_Combinatoria, 73].

### Scientism

![W.V.O. Quine meme by [Daniel Estrada](https://plus.google.com/+DanielEstrada/posts/VPPtWTLTyUC).](img/quine-naturalism.png){#fig:quine-naturalism}

>   Yet people, sticks, stones, electrons, and molecules are real indeed, on my view,
>   and it is these and no dim proxies that science is all about. Now how is such
>   robust realism to be reconciled with what we have just been through? The answer
>   is naturalism: the recognition that it is within science itself, and not in
>   some prior philosophy, that reality is properly to be identified and
>   described.  [^Quine-1981]

-   methodological naturalism
-   What are the limits of science?
-   Are there other ways of knowing?
-   Unity of knowledge
-   Wilson, E.O. (1998). *Consilience*. [^Wilson1998]

[^Quine-1981]: @Quine_1981_Reply_to_Stroud, p. 474. A similar quote can be
    found in @Quine_1981_Theories_and_Things, p. 21.

### Rejection of *a priori* metaphysics

Metaphysical naturalism.

TODO: While promoting the careful gathering of empirical information,
naturalism is not against (largely non-empirical) rational pursuits like mathematics.
Indeed some naturalist may even see logic and mathematics as scientific pursuits
of *a priori* truths.

TODO: Naturalism shares much in common with schools of thought surrounding positivism,
through its respect for science and skepticism of *a priori* metaphysics,
but naturalism is a more general distinction,
being a more much longer thread throughout the history of philosophy and science.

![A version of the "distracted boyfriend meme" maligning  *a priori* metaphysics.](img/distracted-boyfriend-meme-intuitions-data.png){#fig:distracted-boyfriend-meme-intuitions-data}

Kant in his *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics*:

>   My object is to persuade all those who think Metaphysics worth studying, 
>   that it is absolutely necessary to pause a moment, 
>   and, neglecting all that has been done, 
>   to propose first the preliminary question, 
>   'Whether such a thing as metaphysics be at all possible?'
>   
>   If it be a science, how comes it that it cannot, like other sciences, 
>   obtain universal and permanent recognition ? If not, how can it maintain
>   its pretensions, and keep the human mind in suspense with hopes, never ceasing, 
>   yet never fulfilled? Whether then we demonstrate our knowledge or our ignorance 
>   in this field, we must come once for all to a definite conclusion respecting 
>   the nature of this so-called science, which cannot possibly remain on its present footing. 
>   It seems almost ridiculous, while every other science is continually advancing, 
>   that in this, which pretends to be Wisdom incarnate, for whose oracle every 
>   one inquires, we should constantly move round the same spot, without gaining 
>   a single step. And so its followers having melted away, we do not find men 
>   confident of their ability to shine in other sciences venturing their 
>   reputation here, where everybody, however ignorant in other matters, 
>   may deliver a final verdict, as in this domain there is as yet no standard 
>   weight and measure to distinguish sound knowledge from shallow talk. [^Kant1783]

Opening lines to *ETMG*:

>   This is a polemical book. One of its main contentions is that contemporary analytic 
>   metaphysics, a professional activity engaged in by some extremely intelligent and 
>   morally serious people, fails to qualify as part of the enlightened pursuit of 
>   objective truth, and should be discontinued. [^Ladyman2007pi]
