Naturalism
================================================================================

Naturalism is a unifying view of philosophy and science.
It is an attitude about how philosophy should be done (a meta-philosophy)
and about how philosophy relates to science.
Regardless of how one views the realism debate
(discussed in the [previous outline](scientific-realism.html)),
naturalism shows a provocative, unifying way of viewing the projects of
philosophy and science.

Here we also discuss additional meta-philosophical issues
and other worldviews in constrast to naturalism.

What is naturalism?

### First pass

-   Natural philosophy

Sellars:

>   The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
>   things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
>   broadest possible sense of the term. Under 'things in the broadest
>   possible sense' I include such radically different items as not only
>   'cabbages and kings', but numbers and duties, possibilities and finger
>   snaps, aesthetic experience and death. To achieve success in philosophy
>   would be, to use a contemporary turn of phrase, to 'know one's way
>   around' with respect to all these things... [^Sellars1963p1]

Maddy defines naturalism:

>   These days, as more and more philosophers count themselves as naturalists,
>   the term has come to mark little more than a vague science-friendliness.
>   To qualify as unnaturalistic, a contemporary thinker has to insist,
>   for example, that epistemology is an a priori discipline with nothing to
>   learn from empirical psychology or that metaphysical intuitions show


>   So our inquirer will continue her investigation of the world in her familiar
>   ways, despite her encounter with Descartes and his meditator. She will ask
>   traditionally philosophical questions about what there is and how we know it,
>   just as they do, but she will take perception as a mostly reliable guide to
>   the existence of medium-sized physical objects, she will consult her
>   astronomical observations and theories to weigh the existence of black holes,
>   and she will treat questions of knowledge as involving the relations between
>   the world---as she understands it in her physics, chemistry, optics, geology,
>   and so on---and human beings---as she understands them in her physiology,
>   cognitive science, neuroscience, linguistics, and so on.
>   While Descartes's meditator begins by rejecting science and common sense in
>   the hope of founding them more firmly by philosophical means, our inquirer
>   proceeds scientifically and attempts to answer even philosophical questions
>   by appeal to its resources. For Descartes's meditator, philosophy comes
>   first; for our inquirer, it comes second---hence 'Second Philosophy'
>   as opposed to 'First'. Our Character now has a name: she is the
>   Second Philosopher.  [^Maddy2007p18]

Jacobs:

>   Naturalism is an approach to philosophical problems that interprets them as
>   tractable through the methods of the empirical sciences or at least, without
>   a distinctively a priori project of theorizing.  [^Jacobs2002]

Naturalism could be defined as a support for philosophy that is filtered for
plausibility given the information from science[^Ladyman2007].
See the [Outline on the science method](scientific-method.html#is-there-a-universal-scientific-method).

Maudlin gives clear naturalist attitude at the start of *The Metaphysics within Physics*:

>   [M]etaphysics, insofar as it is concerned with the natural world,
>   can do no better than to reflect on physics.
>   Physical theories provide us with the best handle we have on what there is,
>   and the philosopher's proper task is the interpretation and elucidation
>   of those theories. In particular, when choosing the fundamental posits
>   of one's ontology, one must look to scientific practice rather than to
>   philosophical prejudice. [^Maudlin2007p1]

Papineau:

>   The term "naturalism" has no very precise meaning in contemporary philosophy.
>   Its current usage derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century.
>   The self-proclaimed "naturalists" from that period included John Dewey, Ernest Nagel,
>   Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed to ally philosophy
>   more closely with science. They urged that reality is exhausted by nature,
>   containing nothing "supernatural", and that the scientific method should
>   be used to investigate all areas of reality, including the "human spirit"
>   (Krikorian 1944, Kim 2003).

>   So understood, "naturalism" is not a particularly informative term as
>   applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary
>   philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized---that is,
>   they would both reject "supernatural" entities, and allow that science is
>   a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about
>   the "human spirit".

### Second pass

A very diverse set of thinkers are often characterized as naturalists or aligned
with naturalism, at the expense of much clarity in the term, but naturalism
generally consists of varying degrees of either or both:

1.  ***epistemological/methodological naturalism*** - an epistemic respect for
    science and empiricism;
    a methodological commitment to the
    [scientific method](http://rreece.github.io/outline-of-philosophy/scientific-method.html)
    of justifying empirical claims as a route to knowledge,
    if not the chief or perhaps (with a sufficiently broad definition)
    the only route to knowledge.
    *Science should be guiding in what we claim to know*.
2.  ***ontological naturalism*** - has a variety of claims and interpretations,
    but they center on the premise that if we have any claim to what there is,
    it better be informed by and consistent with science.
    It often involves a skepticism of *a priori* metaphysics
    (statements about what there is that come prior to empirical information),
    and sometimes has further qualified ontological commitments to the products of science,
    which concerns the debate of [scientific realism](http://rreece.github.io/outline-of-philosophy/scientific-realism.html).
    Another claim associated with ontological naturalism and closely
    related to epistemological naturalism is a rejection of ontologies to which we
    do not have demonstrable, access *i.e.* supernatural entities,
    which can be seen as a claim to a type of monism as opposed to dualism about ontology.
    There is *one* (natural) world.
    At the least, it is a claim that
    *science should be guiding in what we claim there is*.

Also:

-   Methodological vs ontological naturalism.
-   Sean Carroll: "There is *one* (natural) world."


### History

-   Discussion by McEvilley [^McEvilley2002p325]
-   Archilochus
-   Thales
-   Anaximander
-   Xenophanes

Riepe on the characteristics of naturalism in Indian thought:

>   1.  The naturalist accepts sense experience as the most important avenue of knowledge.
>   2.  The naturalist believes that knowledge is not esoteric, innate, or intuitive (mystical).
>   3.  The naturalist believes that the external world, of which man is an integral part, is objective
>       and hence not "his idea" but an existent apart from his, your, or anyone's consciousness.
>   4.  The naturalist believes that hte world minifests order and regularity and that,
>       contrary to some opinion, this does not exclude human responsibility.
>       This order cannot be changed merely by thought, magic, sacrifice, or prayer,
>       but requires an actual manipulation of the external world in some physical way.
>   5.  The naturalist rejects supernatural teleology. The direction of the world is
>       caused by the world itself.
>   6.  The naturalist is humanistic. Man is not simply a mirror of deity or the absolute
>       but a biological existent whose goal it is to do what is proper to man.
>       What is proper to man is discovered in a naturalistic context by the
>       moral philosopher. [^Riepe1961pX]

Unity of philosophy and science
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Philosophy and science are continuous in concerns.
-   Philosophy is the nursury of budding programs that become specialized sciences.
-   TODO: find more refs.

Descartes (often seen as anti-naturalist, explain, but he) wrote in 1644,

>   Philosophy as a whole is like a tree; of which the roots are Metaphysics,
>   the trunk is Physics, and the branches emerging from this trunk are all
>   the other branches of knowledge. These branches can be reduced to three
>   principal ones, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. [^Descartes1644pxxiv]

-   In the boat with Neurath.

Sellars:

>   Philosophy in an important sense has no special subject-matter which
>   stands to it as other subject-matters stand to other special disciplines.
>   If philosophers did have such a special subject-matter, they could turn it
>   over to a new group of specialists as they have turned other special
>   subject-matters to non-philosophers over the past 2500 years, first with
>   mathematics, more recently psychology and sociology, and, currently,
>   certain aspects of theoretical linguistics. What is characteristic of
>   philosophy is not a special subject-matter, but the aim of knowing one's
>   way around with respect to the subject-matters of all the special
>   disciplines. [^SellarsTODO]

Rejection of *a priori* metaphysics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metaphysical naturalism.

-   Locke on the rejection of innate ideas.

TODO: While promoting the careful gathering of empirical information,
naturalism is not against (largely non-empirical) rational pursuits like mathematics.
Indeed some naturalist may even see logic and mathematics as scientific pursuits
of *a priori* truths.

TODO: Naturalism shares much in common with schools of thought surrounding positivism,
through its respect for science and skepticism of *a priori* metaphysics,
but naturalism is a more general distinction,
being a more much longer thread throughout the history of philosophy and science.

Kant in his *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics*:

>   My object is to persuade all those who think Metaphysics worth studying, 
>   that it is absolutely necessary to pause a moment, 
>   and, neglecting all that has been done, 
>   to propose first the preliminary question, 
>   'Whether such a thing as metaphysics be at all possible?'
>   
>   If it be a science, how comes it that it cannot, like other sciences, 
>   obtain universal and permanent recognition? If not, how can it maintain
>   its pretensions, and keep the human mind in suspense with hopes, never ceasing, 
>   yet never fulfilled? Whether then we demonstrate our knowledge or our ignorance 
>   in this field, we must come once for all to a definite conclusion respecting 
>   the nature of this so-called science, which cannot possibly remain on its present footing. 
>   It seems almost ridiculous, while every other science is continually advancing, 
>   that in this, which pretends to be Wisdom incarnate, for whose oracle every 
>   one inquires, we should constantly move round the same spot, without gaining 
>   a single step. And so its followers having melted away, we do not find men 
>   confident of their ability to shine in other sciences venturing their 
>   reputation here, where everybody, however ignorant in other matters, 
>   may deliver a final verdict, as in this domain there is as yet no standard 
>   weight and measure to distinguish sound knowledge from shallow talk. [^Kant1783]

Quine:

>   At this point let me say that I shall not be impressed by protests that I am
>   using inductive generalizations, Darwin's and others, to justify induction,
>   and thus reasoning in a circle. The reason I shall not be impressed by this
>   is that my position is a naturalistic one;
>   I see philosophy not as an *a priori* propaedeutic or groundwork for science,
>   but as continuous with science. I see philosophy and science as in the same
>   boat---a boat which, to revert to Neurath's figure as I so often do,
>   we can rebuild only at sea while staying afloat in it. There is no external
>   vantage point, no first philosophy. All scientific findings, all scientific
>   conjectures that are at present plausible, are therefore in my view as welcome
>   for use in philosophy as elsewhere. [^Quine1969pX]

More Quine:

>   I also expressed, at the beginning, my unswerving belief in external
>   things---people, nerve endings, sticks, stones. This I reaffirm. I
>   believe also, if less affirmly, in atoms and electrons, and in
>   classes. Now how is all this robust realism to be reconciled with the
>   barren scene that I have just been depicting? *The answer is
>   naturalism: the recognition that it is within science itself, and not
>   some prior philosophy, that reality is properly to be identified
>   and described.* [^Quine1981p21]

Opening lines to *ETMG*:

>   metaphysics, a professional activity engaged in by some extremely intelligent and 
>   morally serious people, fails to qualify as part of the enlightened pursuit of
