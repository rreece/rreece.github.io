### Note this is under construction

This site is my working draft of notes from philosophy papers I read.
I share it here for collaborators and perhaps general interest (when I get it better organized).
If you find any of it useful, please let me know, but please don't distribute widely yet.
I hope to pubish these outlines or some version of them on my blog:
[statisticalsignificance.net](http://statisticalsignificance.net/).
