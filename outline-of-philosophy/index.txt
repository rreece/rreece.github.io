All the following are in flux and development:

1.  [Invitation to scientific philosophy](invitation.html) -- a place to start in the discussion of philosophy of science and naturalism.
1.  [The scientific method](scientific-method.html) -- the key to epistemology.
1.  [Philosophy of statistics](statistics.html)  -- the details behind a justified epistemology.
1.  [Scientific realism](scientific-realism.html) -- the key to metaphysics.
1.  [Naturalism](naturalism.html) -- a metaphilosophy that says science should bootstrap philosophy.
1.  [Philosophy of mathematics](math.html) -- What is abstraction?
1.  [Philosophy of physics](physics.html) -- What are good theories of the world?
1.  [Philosophy of mind](mind.html) -- What is consciousness?
1.  [Ethics](ethics.html) -- What should we do?
1.  [The human condition](human-condition.html) -- What are we?
1.  [Future studies](future.html) -- Where are we going?


### Note: this is under construction

This site is my working draft of notes from philosophy papers I read.
I share it here for collaborators and perhaps general interest (when I get it better organized).
If you find any of it useful, please let me know, but please don't distribute widely yet.
I hope to pubish these outlines or some version of them on my blog:
[statisticalsignificance.net](http://statisticalsignificance.net/).


### Note: scope disclaimer

While the scope of this project is ambitiously large,
clearly it cannot pretend to represent *all* of philosophy by any stretch.
This is a meandering of one person through his own thoughts on philosophy,
a meandering that is primarily western and focused on empiricism,
although not entirely either.
