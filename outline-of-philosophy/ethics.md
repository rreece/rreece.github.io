Ethics
================================================================================

Ethics: What should we do? What is good? What is normative?

Meta-ethics: What is goodness? What does it mean to be good? What does it mean to be normative?

Aesthetics: What is beautiful?

>   What may a man do and not be ashamed of it? He may not do nothing surely,
>   for straightaway he is dubbed Dolittle---aye!
>   christens himself first---and reasonably, for he was first to duck.
>   But let him do something, is he the less a Dolittle?
>   Is it actually something done, or not rather something undone? [^Thoreau5Mar1838]

Moral antirealism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   The previous three sections are about ethics; the next three are about
    meta-ethics.
-   Cognitivism and non-cognitivism
-   Emotivism
    -   Hume, A.J. Ayer
    -   Reason is a slave to the passions
    -   Positivism
-   Relativism
-   Nihilism
    -   Friedrich Nietzsche
    -   J.L. Mackie
-   Postmodernism
-   Moral antirealism is the disjunction of three theses:
    1. moral noncognitivism
    2. moral error theory
    3. moral non-objectivism [^SEPMoralAntirealism]

Thrasymachus in Plato's *Republic*:

>   Listen then, I say justice is nothing other than the advantage of the
>   stronger. [^RepublicI338c]

Hume:

>   Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding as
>   of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt, more
>   properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it, and endeavour to
>   fix its standard, we regard a new fact, to wit, the general taste of mankind,
>   or some such fact, which may be the object of reasoning and
>   enquiry. [^Hume2007p120morals]

The end of section 3.1.1 from Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature*,
"Moral distinctions not derived from reason":

>   In every system of morality, which I have
>   hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the
>   author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of
>   reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes
>   observations concerning human affairs; when of a
>   sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual
>   copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no
>   proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an
>   ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however,
>   of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not,
>   expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is
>   necessary that it should be observed and explained; and
>   at the same time that a reason should be given, for what
>   seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation
>   can be a deduction from others, which are entirely
>   different from it. But as authors do not commonly use
>   this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the
>   readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention
>   would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let
>   us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not
>   founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is
>   perceived by reason. [^Hume2009p715]

Moral realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   Moral realism is the conjunction of three theses:
    1. moral cognitivism
    2. rejection of error theory; some moral judgements are true
    3. stance independence; some moral judgements are objectively true
-   Moral realism can be further divided between moral naturalism and
    moral non-naturalism, discussed in the next section.
-   Plato: [*Minos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos_(dialogue))
-   Objectivity, structure, context, invariance

Plato:

>   What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe
>   in the beautiful itself and isn't able to follow anyone who could lead him
>   to the knowledge of it? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than
>   a wakened state? Isn't this dreaming: whether asleep or awake, to think
>   that a likeness is not a likeness but rather the thing itself that it is
>   like?
>   
>   I certainly think that someone who does that is dreaming.
>   
>   But someone who, to take the opposite case, believes in the beautiful itself,
>   can see both it and the things that participate in it and doesn't believe that
>   the participants are it or that it itself is the participants---he is living
>   in a dream or is he awake?
>   
>   He's very much awake. [^RepublicV476c]

Moral naturalism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   Moral naturalism is the conjunction of moral realism and the thesis that
    moral facts are natural facts.
-   Moral naturalism can be further divided into reductive and non-reductive
    moral naturalism.
    -   Reductive moral naturalism rejects that the normative cannot be reduced
        to the descriptive; rejects the is-ought divide

Stephen R. Brown:

>   *Ethical naturalism*: Cognitivist ethical theories in which important
>   ethical norms and evaluations are grounded in natural facts. [^Brown2008p2]

Moral naturalists:

-   Moritz Schlick
-   Victor Kraft
-   Sam Harris
-   [Cornell realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_realism)
    -    Richard Boyd, Nicholas Sturgeon, and David Brink

-   Bowling, M., Burch, N., Johanson, M., & Tammelin, O. (2015). Heads-up limit hold'em poker is solved. [^Bowling2015b]

Resnik:

>   The best thing to do is to avoid games like the clash of wills and the prisoner's
>   dilemma in the first place. People who are confronted with such situations
>   quickly learn to take steps to avoid them. We have already mentioned the criminals'
>   code of silence in connection with the prisoner's dilemma. Families often
>   adopt rules for taking turns at tasks (dish washing) or pleasures (using the family
>   car) to avoid repeated plays of the clash of wills. Since such rules represent a
>   limited form of morality, we can see the breakdowns in game theory as paving
>   the way for an argument that it is rational to be moral. [^Resnik1987p152]

>   existing social ecology. ... from the perspective of neuroscience and brain
>   evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior
>   based on Hume's warning against deriving ought from is seems unfortunate,
>   especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences. ...
>   The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for
>   caring---for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin,
>   and others---shape social reasoning about many issues:
>   conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource
>   distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast

Return of a portfolio:

$$ r = \vec{w}^\intercal \, \vec{r} = \sum_i w_{i} \, r_{i} $$

Variance of a portfolio:

$$ \sigma^2 = \vec{w}^\intercal \, V \, \vec{w} = \sum_{ij} w_{i} \, V_{ij} \, w_{j}  $$

TODO: Show above

The *Markowitz portfolio problem*: [^Markowitz1959p172]
Given an $n$-dimensional vector of expected returns, $\vec{\mu}$,
an $n\times{}n$-dimensional expected covariance matrix, $V$,
an $m\times{}n$-dimensional constraint matrix, $A$,
an $m$-dimensional constraint vector, $\vec{b}$,
and a target return, $r$,
solve for the portfolio weights, $\vec{w}^{\ast}$, an $n$-dimensional vector,
that are *efficient*, *i,e.* those
that minimize the standard deviation of the portfolio return, $\sigma$,
for a given target return.
Return $(\vec{w}^{\ast}, \sigma^{\ast})$.

$$ \vec{w}^{\ast} = \underset{w}{\mathrm{argmin}}\ \vec{w}^\intercal \, V \, \vec{w} $$

such that

$$ \vec{w}^\intercal \, \vec{1} = \sum_i w_i = 1 $$

$$ \vec{w}^\intercal \, \vec{\mu} = \sum_i w_i \, \mu_i = r $$

There are a lot of topics to discuss about solving for the efficient frontier:

-   How there is an analytic solution if you allow shorts
-   Solving with Lagrange multipliers
-   Solving with numerical convex optimization

TODO: Discuss the above more.

It can be shown [^MertonVariables] that there is an analytic solution where:

$$ a \equiv \vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{1}, \qquad  b \equiv \vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}, \qquad c \equiv \vec{\mu}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}, \qquad d \equiv a\,c - b^2 $$

There are two efficient portfolios of note: the minimum variance portfolio, $\vec{w}_v$,
and the tangent portfolio, $\vec{w}_t$.

The *minimum variance portfolio* is

$$ \vec{w}_{v} = \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{1}}{a} = \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{1}}{\vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{1}} $$

It has a return

$$ r_{v} = \vec{w}_{v} \cdot \vec{\mu} = \frac{\vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{a} = \frac{b}{a} $$

and a variance

$$ \sigma_{v}^2 = \vec{w}_{v}^\intercal \, V \, \vec{w}_{v} = \left( \frac{\vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1}}{a} \right) V \left( \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{1}}{a} \right) = \frac{\vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{1}}{a^2} = \frac{1}{a} $$

The *tangent portfolio* is

$$ \vec{w}_{t} = \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{b} = \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{\vec{1}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}} $$

It has a return

$$ r_{t} = \vec{w}_{t} \cdot \vec{\mu} = \frac{\vec{\mu}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{b} = \frac{c}{b} $$

and a variance

$$ \sigma_{t}^2 = \vec{w}_{t}^\intercal \, V \, \vec{w}_{t} = \left( \frac{\vec{\mu}^\intercal \, V^{-1}}{b} \right) V \left( \frac{V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{b} \right) = \frac{\vec{\mu}^\intercal \, V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}}{b^2} = \frac{c}{b^2} $$

The efficient frontier can be written as a linear combination of any two efficient portfolios.
This is discussed in more detail in the section on [Fund theorems](#fund-theorems).
Written as a combination of the minimum variance and the tangent portfolios gives

$$ \vec{w}_{\ast} = \xi \, \vec{w}_{v} + (1-\xi) \, \vec{w}_{t} $$

where

$$ \xi = (c - b \, r) \, a \, / \, d $$

It's not trivial, but equivalently, the efficient frontier portfolio can be written

\begin{align}
\vec{w}_{\ast} &= \xi \, \vec{w}_{v} + (1-\xi) \, \vec{w}_{t} \\
      &= \left( \frac{c - b \, r_{\ast}}{d} \right) a \, \vec{w}_{v} + \left( \frac{a \, r_{\ast} - b}{d} \right) b \, \vec{w}_{t} \\
      &= \left( \frac{c - b \, r_{\ast}}{d} \right) V^{-1} \, \vec{1} + \left( \frac{a \, r_{\ast} - b}{d} \right) V^{-1} \, \vec{\mu}
\end{align}

Along the frontier, the return is

$$ r_{\ast} = \xi \, r_{v} + (1-\xi) \, r_{t} $$

The variance is

$$ \sigma^2_{\ast} = \frac{a}{d} \, r_{\ast}^{2} - \frac{2 \, b}{d} \, r_{\ast} + \frac{c}{d} $$

In general, depending on the correlations of the assets, the efficient frontier portfolios will
short various positions by having negative weights.

If one adds an additional constraint to the Markowitz portfolio problem as stated,
requiring that we don't short any positions

$$ w_i \geq  0 $$

then the problem doesn't have an analytic solution.
TODO: Citation needed.

The *No-shorts frontier* can be solved numerically with quadratic programming.
In general, the no-shorts frontier will follow the unconstrained efficient frontier
when there isn't any shorting in the efficient portfolios,
and the no-shorts frontier will pull away from the efficient frontier
to somewhat lower returns when there is shorting.

Quadratic programming and convex optimization are discussed in more detail
in the section on [Convex optimization](#convex-optimization).

Debating moral realism with Sean Carroll.

AMA question about naturalism and moral realism.

-   My question on Sean Carroll's [AMA on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26msnd/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/chskkvr)
-   Repost of the question on his [blog](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/05/27/the-meaning-of-life-2/)

> As a fellow physicist (experimenter with ATLAS) also with an interest in philosophy, I'm really impressed by your efforts to push naturalism and engage philosophers. I fully agree with your materialist and reductionist arguments, supporting that we do understand physics within the everyday regime, and this should inform our metaphysics, philosophy of mind, criticism of pseudoscience, etc. I also like that you emphasize emergence as being an important concept in explaining the nested emergent ontologies in chemistry, biology, economics, etc. My question is why you seem to draw a hard line that ethics and morality cannot be analyzed in the same way. You seem to entertain the criticisms that some people say of "scientism", that there are some things (like ethics) to which the reductive program of science will not be able to explain. This strikes me as totally inconsistent with the thrust of reductionism and naturalism. I think there are reasonable explanations for why ethics emerge as a set of regularities and good strategies anytime you have groups of people. The constraints on ethics seem to be completely determined by the natural world, including the limits of resources, the needs of our physiology, the laws of probability and game theory, etc. There is no fundamental is/ought divide. "Ought" is a higher descriptive term we give to actions that bring out good situations, for which there are objective metrics, such as health and satisfaction. In this regard, I'm sympathetic with some utilitarians and what Sam Harris seems to be describing in the Moral Landscape. Why do you think emergence from natural laws can introduce new concepts like temperature, phase transitions, supply and demand, but not ethics?

Sean's reply:

> Ryan --- Essentially, science is about describing the world, not passing judgment on it.
> Temperature, phase transitions, and supply and demand are all concepts that helps us
> understand what happens in the world. Morality is just a completely different endeavor.
> (Of course you can scientifically study how human beings actually
> behave --- including what they judge to be "moral" --- but that's
> different than studying how they should behave.)
> Scientific claims can be judged by experiments, moral claims cannot.

TODO: Drafting a reply.

I know I'm a consequentialist and a moral realist, but those are broad categories.

There's no unified or received view of the fact/value, descriptive/normative divide since Hume. But that doesn't mean there aren't naturalistic philosophers that deny the dichotomy, i.e., would support the idea roughly that there is a scientific way of discussing and determining what is better. Health and nutrition seem like obvious plausible examples, really any reasoned strategy is normative: it tells one what one should do given what is known. In this sense many naturalists are aligned with game theoretic reasoning about what we should do.

Thought experiment on moral naturalism:

-   Agree that chess (or poker) has better and worse play
-   Add another task to the competition: do laundry while playing,
    also while trying to sell a product over the phone,
    or a more typical triatholan: cycle, swim, run, etc.
    As we add tasks, there doesn't stop being better and worse
    overall strategies, albeit complication grows.
-   Finally, we ask the meta question of what to do next.
