### Moral Realism

Debating moral realism with Sean Carroll.

AMA question about naturalism and moral realism.

-   My question on Sean Carroll's [AMA on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26msnd/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/chskkvr)
-   Repost of the question on his [blog](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/05/27/the-meaning-of-life-2/)

> As a fellow physicist (experimenter with ATLAS) also with an interest in philosophy, I'm really impressed by your efforts to push naturalism and engage philosophers. I fully agree with your materialist and reductionist arguments, supporting that we do understand physics within the everyday regime, and this should inform our metaphysics, philosophy of mind, criticism of pseudoscience, etc. I also like that you emphasize emergence as being an important concept in explaining the nested emergent ontologies in chemistry, biology, economics, etc. My question is why you seem to draw a hard line that ethics and morality cannot be analyzed in the same way. You seem to entertain the criticisms that some people say of "scientism", that there are some things (like ethics) to which the reductive program of science will not be able to explain. This strikes me as totally inconsistent with the thrust of reductionism and naturalism. I think there are reasonable explanations for why ethics emerge as a set of regularities and good strategies anytime you have groups of people. The constraints on ethics seem to be completely determined by the natural world, including the limits of resources, the needs of our physiology, the laws of probability and game theory, etc. There is no fundamental is/ought divide. "Ought" is a higher descriptive term we give to actions that bring out good situations, for which there are objective metrics, such as health and satisfaction. In this regard, I'm sympathetic with some utilitarians and what Sam Harris seems to be describing in the Moral Landscape. Why do you think emergence from natural laws can introduce new concepts like temperature, phase transitions, supply and demand, but not ethics?

Sean's reply:

> Ryan --- Essentially, science is about describing the world, not passing judgment on it.
> Temperature, phase transitions, and supply and demand are all concepts that helps us
> understand what happens in the world. Morality is just a completely different endeavor.
> (Of course you can scientifically study how human beings actually
> behave --- including what they judge to be "moral" --- but that's
> different than studying how they should behave.)
> Scientific claims can be judged by experiments, moral claims cannot.

Drafting a reply

TODO.

I know I'm a consequentialist and a moral realist, but those are broad categories.

<!---

This sounds legit to me so far:
[Scalon's Contractualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.M._Scanlon)

    i'm trying to understand the space of ethical positions
    and really find my ism
    Sent at 2:08 PM on Sunday
    me:  i'm a consequentialist, but thats a broad category
    Sent at 2:10 PM on Sunday
    me:  and i dont completely eliminate deontological justifications,
    they just arent primary
    he conequences are primary in defining whats good
    but then we make norms that are good general rules to optimize
    the consequences
    like dont kill
    dont lie
    and those norms are what gets honorific
    and thats why people want to use honor or similar deontological reasons
    but they are secondary, emergent rules of thumb
    and basically i think the best strategy is that people live their maxims
    and try to be honorable
    like satisfying a contract with society
    but in the end, the point is to have good consequences
    so thats the balance of means and ends
    these ideas sound like what Scalon's Contractualism
    but in addition to that
    i'm a moral realist
    cause i think the truths are true like math is true
    and a moral pragmatist
    cause i think our morality in practice evolves and does improve
    with investigation like science does

    don ross gets it
    and stay with it till dennett says that he's a consequentialist,
    but not a naive one at ~7m
