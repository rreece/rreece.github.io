Scientific realism
================================================================================

Can we claim to know anything about reality?
Is it a goal of science to describe reality?
Does science make any progress at describing reality?
This outline focuses on the issues of *metaphysical* progress
from science, while the 
[Outline on the scientific method](scientific-method.html)
discusses the epistemological foundations and limitations of science.

Metaphysics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When one encounters the word "metaphysics", what is usually meant is one of the
three following ideas:

-   What *really* exists, or at least what exist literally beyond what we know
    in physics.  This is one of the oldest and fundamental branches in philosophy.
    In a naturalist sense, high-energy theoretical physics can be seen as
    examples of theoretical metaphysics at its best, ideas about about what
    there exists at a more fundamental level based on what we know at more
    pedestrian levels of experience.
-   A pejorative word, denoting ideas that are meaningless because they are
    claims beyond what is verifiable.  This was the view of the positivistists.
-   A loosely, if ill-defined, woo-woo word in which a mystic, guru, or metaphysician
    may claim to specialize.

van Inwagen:

>   The word 'metaphysics' is derived from a collective title of the fourteen books by
>   Aristotle that we currently think of as making up Aristotle's *Metaphysics*.
>   Aristotle himself did not know the word. (He had four names for the branch of
>   philosophy that is the subject-matter of Metaphysics: 'first philosophy', 
>   'first science', 'wisdom', and 'theology'.) At least one hundred years after
>   Aristotle's death, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of Rhodes) 
>   titled those fourteen books "*Ta meta ta phusika*"---"the after the physicals" or 
>   "the ones after the physical ones"---the "physical ones" being the books contained
>   in what we now call Aristotle's *Physics*. The title was probably meant to warn
>   students of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt Metaphysics only after
>   they had mastered "the physical ones", the books about nature or the natural
>   world. [^vanInwagen2014]

Stealing from encyclopedia.com:

>   In medieval and modern philosophy "metaphysics" has also been taken to mean the study
>   of things transcending nature---that is, existing separately from nature and having
>   more intrinsic reality and value than the things of nature---giving *meta*
>   a philosophical meaning it did not have in classical Greek.
>   
>   Especially since Immanuel Kant metaphysics has often meant a priori speculation on
>   questions that cannot be answered by scientific observation and experiment.
>   Popularly, "metaphysics" has meant anything abstruse and highly theoretical---a common
>   eighteenth-century usage illustrated by David Hume's occasional use of metaphysical to
>   mean "excessively subtle". The term has also been popularly associated with the spiritual,
>   the religious, and even the occult. In modern philosophical usage metaphysics refers
>   generally to the field of philosophy dealing with questions about the kinds of things
>   there are and their modes of being. Its subject matter includes the concepts of existence,
>   thing, property, event; the distinctions between particulars and universals,
>   individuals and classes; the nature of relations, change, causation; and the nature of mind,
>   matter, space, and time.

Realism and antirealism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Allegory of the Cave

-   Naive realism.  Why would I doubt the world I see is real?
-   Reification fallacy
-   Plato: Allegory of the Cave. [^RepublicVII514]

### Early modern skepticism

-   Many philosophers in that Early Modern Period had threads of Idealism (wikipedia: reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core). *e.g.* George Berkeley, Kant, Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
-   Descartes' demon


### Modern skepticism

-   "Here is one hand" - Moore [^Moore1925]
-   "On Certainty" - Wittgenstein
-   The map and the territory

Korzybski:

>   A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. [^Korzybski1933p58]

Borges:

>   **On Exactitude in Science**
>
>   ... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

Positivism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Theses

1.  Hume's fork, the analytic/synthetic distinction
2.  Verification theory of meaning: the meaning of a proposition is the means to verify it.
    All statements that cannot be empirically verified in principle are meaningless.
3.  Carnap's principle of tolerance
4.  Unity of science

-   antirealist
-   nominalism

Positivism is a philosophy of science and epistemology that roughly defends a
qualified empiricism, that the scientific method is the only route to knowledge,
and that all statements that cannot be empirically verified are meaningless.
Positivism is strongly eliminative about metaphysics and claims that many
metaphysical questions and positions are not open or false, but meaningless
because of their lack of attachment to empirically demonstrable things or effects.

Google:

>   Logical positivism: a form of positivism, developed by members of the Vienna Circle, that considers that the only meaningful philosophical problems are those that can be solved by logical analysis.

This means that positivism is generally seen to imply antirealist views of science and mathematics, preferring as Carnap says in _Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology_:

>   Empiricists are in general rather suspicious with respect to any kind of abstract 
>   entities like properties, classes, relations, numbers, propositions, etc. 
>   They usually feel much more in sympathy with nominalists than with realists (in the medieval sense).
>   As far as possible they try to avoid any reference to abstract entities and to 
>   restrict themselves to what is sometimes called a nominalistic language, i.e.,
>   one not containing such references. [^Carnap1950p1]

Positivists have instrumentalist (antirealist) views about the models science
produces, given that they are constructed from abstractions and involve the
epistemological limitations of induction and theory change. As a qualified sort
of empiricism that supports the primacy of the scientific method, positivism
is sometimes equated with scientism (often derogatorily) if one takes it to
claim that science is the only way to attain knowledge.

In a more general sense, positivism is aligned with naturalism, the
meta-philosophy that roughly says that science should inform and bootstrap
our philosophical claims. Naturalists, having a more broadly aligned and
various support for science, may not have such exclusive views of
epistemology or such eliminative views of metaphysics. Many naturalists are
instead realists about science, math, and/or ethics, for example following
a version of structural realism about the discoveries from science, capturing
and constraining real structures in nature.

### Early positivism

#### Auguste Comte

Comte on the unknowability of the composition of stars:

>   On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible
>   to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can
>   conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their
>   motions, we shall never be able by any means to study their chemical composition
>   or their mineralogical structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous
>   envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive
>   power, we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition
>   or even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean
>   temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. [^Comte1835stars]

>   by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical 
>   technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite

>   at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, 
>   resemble those of science. [^Russell1945p834]

Postpositivism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Various reactions to positivism.

-   Karl Popper (1902-1994)
-   Willard Van Orman Quine (1908-2000)
-   Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996)
-   Imre Lakatos (1922-1974)
-   Nancy Cartwright (b. 1944)


### Attack on the analytic/synthetic distinction

>   Among the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing
>   were Quine's attack on the analytic/synthetic distinction, which was
>   generally taken to undermine Carnap's distinction between existence
>   questions internal to a framework and those external to
>   it. [^WikipediaMetaphysics]

-   Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" [^Quine1951-2]
    1.  analytic/synthetic distinction
    2.  reductionism (verification theory of meaning)
-   Quine: pale gray lore. TODO: find quote.
-   Duhem-Quine thesis
-   inscrutability of reference
-   Quine-Carnap correspondence [^Quine1990-2]
-   Does ontology rest on a mistake? [^Yablo1998]

### Ordinary language philosophy

-   Late Wittgenstein
-   @Wittgenstein_2009_Philosophical_Investigations\. *Philosophical Investigations*.
-   Instrumentalist and pragmatist
-   An imprtant project is to understand the differences between early (*TLP*)
    and late (*PI*) Wittgenstein. It is quite the about-face.
    -   TLP: Language has a structure that can be mapped onto (meaning) the logical structure of the world
    -   PI: The meaning of a word is its use.

Wittgenstein in *PI*:

>   Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language.

TODO: find ref of above quote.


### Theory change

-   Poincar&eacute;
-   Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996)
    -   paradigm shifts
    -   normal science and revolutionary science
-   Imre Lakatos (1922-1974)
    -   scientific research programmes
-   Larry  Laudan (b. 1941)
    -   scientific research traditions
    -   pessimistic meta-induction (PMI)
    -   science cannot be value free

Poincar&eacute;:

>   At first blush it seems to us that the theories last only a day
>   and that ruins upon ruins accumulate.
>   Today the theories are born, tomorrow they are the fashion,
>   the day after tomorrow they are classic,
>   the fourth day they are superannuated,
>   and the fifth they are forgotten. [^Poincare1913p351]


### The "death" of positivism

-   anti-positivism, Kuhn, Popper
-   post-structuralism, postmodernism (continental)
-   Ayer, A.J. 

Ayer:

>   The most important defect was that nearly all of it was false. [^Ayer1978]

[^Ayer1978]: @Ayer_1978_Logical_positivism_and_its_legacy\.


### Realist turn

-   a turn towards realism
-   Poincar&eacute;
    -   structure
-   Karl Popper (1902-1994)
    -   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.
    -   *falsifiability* over *verifiability*
-   Putnam, NMA

Popper:

>   Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories---the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences---are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.) Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories.

Constructive empiricism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Science aims to give us theories that are empirically adequate,
but does not justify metaphysical claims about reality.

-   antirealist
-   van Fraassen's "Arguments Concerning Scientific Realism" [^vanFraassen1980]
-   van Fraassen and Bueno
-   Unlike positivism/instrumentalism, theories should be taken literally.

Structural realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Science has identified real patterns, relationships, and structures
(at least within a regime) in nature.

-   realist
-   Plato's injunction in the *Phaedrus* to carve nature at its joints 
-   early Wittgenstein: picture theory of language/meaning
-   strucuturalism more generally and structural anthropology: Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss
-   [Inverse problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem)
    -   Wikipedia: "Inverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in science and mathematics because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe."
-   Henri Poincar&eacute;

Poincar&eacute;:

>   [W]hat is objective must be common to many minds and consequently transmissible from one to the other. ...
>   [P]ure quality ... is intransmissible... . But it is not the same with relations...
>   From this point of view, what is objective is ... only pure relation. [^Poincare1913p347]

Critical realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Critical realists believe that there are unobservable events which cause the
observable ones; as such, the social world can be understood only if people
understand the structures that generate such unobservable events.

-   realist
-   Roy Wood Sellars, Wilfrid Sellars
-   Roy Bhaskar
-   Freely emphasizes the political implications of scientific realism.
-   The normative importance of climate science.


Active realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Hasok Chang


My thoughts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, I plan to summarize my thoughts after finishing the analysis of
several sources below.

Ways to phrase the issue:

-   Does your worldview have commitments to ontologies claimed to be part of reality?
-   Is the goal of science to describe reality?  Does science make any progress at that?

Misc.:

-   Relation to naturalism and mathematical realism.
-   We should remind ourselves that independent of our debate, the world is doing
    something in certain ways and not in others.

Questions:

-   Is there a position that requires *any* element of a good scientific theory to
    be interpretable?  What would that mean?
-   Maybe scientism is really the same thing positivism re-branded;
    similarly, naturalism is empiricism re-branded.

### Carnap, R. (1950). Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology.

-   @Carnap_1950_Empiricism_semantics_and_ontology

#### 1. The problem of abstract entities

-   Empiricists tend to prefer to restrict themselves to
    *nominalistic language* -- without containing references to abstract entities.
-   Formalists view mathematics as a mechanistic calculus without interpretation,
    but physics seems to lend its own interpretation.

>   In physics it is more difficult to shun the suspected entities because the language
>   of physics serves for the communication of reports and predictions and hence
>   cannot be taken as a mere calculus.

-   A physicist may declare some parts of a theory as uninterpretable.
-   Carnap says his purpose is to clarify that *empiricists can accept a
    language referring to abstract entities without embracing platonic ontologies*.

#### 2. Linguistic frameworks

-   Carnap defines *linguistic frameworks*, *internal* vs *external* questions
    (internal to the framework or about the metaphysical world),
    and the *world of things*.

>   To recognize something as a real thing or event means to succeed in
>   incorporating it into the system of things at a particular space-time
>   position so that it fits together with the other things as real,
>   according to the rules of the framework.

-   Carnap distinguishes that only the philosopher
    (not the man on the street nor the scientist)
    asks the external questions about reality outside the linguistic framework.
-   Carnap goes on about what it means to accept the *thing language*.
    The system can be constructed by introducing new language expressions
    (as a sequence of `typedef`s, as he seems to mean).

#### 3. What does acceptance of a kind of entities mean?

#### 4. Abstract entities in semantics

#### 5. Conclusion

#### My thoughts

-   Sometimes I feel like Carnap repeats his theses though as if that helps support them.
    He says over and over that accepting a thing in a language is practical matter,
    not a theoretical/metaphysical one, which I agree with to a degree.
    But then that leaves us on the edge of a lot of semantic cliffs,
    saying "but what do our abstract entities mean?", or rather,
    "what does their scientific success mean?".
-   In the end, my impression is that I'm still not satisfied with nominalism.
    I feel like the road to addressing Carnap, the issues he should have acknowledged,
    is that some of our abstract classes are *super fucking natural*.
    The success of some instances of our abstract internal languages
    should lead one, through the same methods of scientific inference that we do
    within the internal language,
    to do *abduction to natural kinds* in the external world.
    To deny the likely success of that abduction is to plead that there is a conspiracy.
