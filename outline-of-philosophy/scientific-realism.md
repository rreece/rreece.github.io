 Scientific realism
================================================================================

Can we claim to know anything about reality?
Is it a goal of science to describe reality?
Does science make any progress at describing reality?
This outline focuses on the issues of *metaphysical* progress
from science, while the 
[Outline on the scientific method](scientific-method.html)
discusses the epistemological foundations and limitations of science.

Issues and positions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Metaphysics

When one encounters the word "metaphysics", what is usually meant is one of the
three following ideas:

-   What *really* exists, or at least what exist literally beyond what we know
    in physics.  This is one of the oldest and fundamental branches in philosophy.
    In a naturalist sense, high-energy theoretical physics can be seen as
    examples of theoretical metaphysics at its best, ideas about about what
    there exists at a more fundamental level based on what we know at more
    pedestrian levels of experience.
-   A pejorative word, denoting ideas that are meaningless because they are
    claims beyond what is verifiable.  This was the view of the positivistists.
-   A loosely, if ill-defined, woo-woo word in which a mystic, guru, or metaphysician
    may claim to specialize.

>   The word 'metaphysics' is derived from a collective title of the fourteen books by
>   Aristotle that we currently think of as making up Aristotle's *Metaphysics*.
>   Aristotle himself did not know the word. (He had four names for the branch of
>   philosophy that is the subject-matter of Metaphysics: 'first philosophy', 
>   'first science', 'wisdom', and 'theology'.) At least one hundred years after
>   Aristotle's death, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of Rhodes) 
>   titled those fourteen books "*Ta meta ta phusika*"---"the after the physicals" or 
>   "the ones after the physical ones"---the "physical ones" being the books contained
>   in what we now call Aristotle's *Physics*. The title was probably meant to warn
>   students of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt Metaphysics only after
>   they had mastered "the physical ones", the books about nature or the natural
>   world. [^vanInwagen2014]

[^vanInwagen2014]: @vanInwagen_2014_Metaphysics\.

Stealing from encyclopedia.com:

>   In medieval and modern philosophy "metaphysics" has also been taken to mean the study
>   of things transcending nature---that is, existing separately from nature and having
>   more intrinsic reality and value than the things of nature---giving *meta*
>   a philosophical meaning it did not have in classical Greek.
>   
>   Especially since Immanuel Kant metaphysics has often meant a priori speculation on
>   questions that cannot be answered by scientific observation and experiment.
>   Popularly, "metaphysics" has meant anything abstruse and highly theoretical---a common
>   eighteenth-century usage illustrated by David Hume's occasional use of metaphysical to
>   mean "excessively subtle". The term has also been popularly associated with the spiritual,
>   the religious, and even the occult. In modern philosophical usage metaphysics refers
>   generally to the field of philosophy dealing with questions about the kinds of things
>   there are and their modes of being. Its subject matter includes the concepts of existence,
>   thing, property, event; the distinctions between particulars and universals,
>   individuals and classes; the nature of relations, change, causation; and the nature of mind,
>   matter, space, and time.


### Realism and anti-realism

-   Naive realism.  Why would I doubt the world I see is real?
-   Many philosophers in that Early Modern Period had threads of Idealism (wikipedia: reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core). *e.g.* George Berkeley, Kant, Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

### Humeanism and necessity

-   laws of nature
-   Humean vs Non-humean :: regularity vs necessitarianism
-   Donald Davidson
-   David Lewis and Humean supervenience:

>   Humean supervenience is named in honor of the greater denier of necessary
>   connections. It is the doctrine that all there is to the world is a vast
>   mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then

### Instrumentalism

Theoretical concepts may have use in predicting observations,
but we have no ontological commitments to them.

-   anti-realist
-   Duhem
-   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism): "Initially a novel perspective introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today." [^Torretti1999]
-   Later Wittgenstein in *PI*. See [Postpositivism](#postpositivism), below.

>   There is an enormous gap between so-called analytic philosophy which broadly agrees
>   that there is something special about science and scientific method, and tries to
>   pin down exactly what it is, and the modern continental tradition which is deeply
>   suspicious of science and its claims to truth and certainty, and generally
>   espouses a cultural relativism that derives from Nietzsche and goes all the way
>   to the postmodern extremes of Derrida and his ilk. There is also the social
>   constructivism that sees scientific facts as mere 'social constructions' and is a
>   direct offshoot of the continental relativism. But the analytic tradition itself
>   divides sharply between instrumentalism and realism, the former seeing theories
>   in physics as mathematical 'black boxes' linking empirical input with empirical
>   output, while the latter seeks to go behind the purely observational data, and
>   reveal something at least of the hidden 'theoretical' processes that lie behind
>   and explain the observational regularities. [^Redhead1999p34]

### Positivism

Verification theory of meaning: All statements that can't be empirically verified are meaningless.

-   anti-realist
-   Auguste Comte
-   Comte and Mill
-   Ernst Mach
-   Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Afred North Whitehead, George
    Edward Moore. Ludwig Wittgenstein *Principia Mathematica*.
-   Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*. [^Wittgenstein1922]
-   Logical positivism, Vienna circle[^Murzi2004], Moritz Schlick,
    Rudolf Carnap, Kurt G&ouml;del, Otto Neurath, and others.
-   A.J. Ayer [^Ayer1936]
-   Logical empiricism - Creathe [^Creathe2011]
-   verificationism, nominalism, quietism
-   von Neuman, Hilbert
-   Hans Reichenbach (1891-1953) and the Berlin Circle
-   International Encyclopedia of Unified Science

Positivism is a philosophy of science and epistemology that roughly defends a
qualified empiricism, that the scientific method is the only route to knowledge,
and that all statements that cannot be empirically verified are meaningless.
Positivism is strongly eliminative about metaphysics and claims that many
metaphysical questions and positions are not open or false, but meaningless
because of their lack of attachment to empirically demonstrable things or effects.

Russell:

>   Modern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume 
>   by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical 
>   technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite 
>   answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has 
>   the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of 
>   being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent
>   at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, 
>   resemble those of science. [^Russell1945p834]

Google:

>   Logical positivism: a form of positivism, developed by members of the Vienna Circle, that considers that the only meaningful philosophical problems are those that can be solved by logical analysis.

Note any differences between:

-   positivism - Comte, Mach
-   logical positivism - Vienna Circle
-   logical empiricism - Reichenbach's preferred term[^Reichenbach], Berlin Circle

This means that positivism is generally seen to imply anti-realist views of science and mathematics, preferring as Carnap says in _Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology_:

>   Empiricists are in general rather suspicious with respect to any kind of abstract 
>   entities like properties, classes, relations, numbers, propositions, etc. 
>   They usually feel much more in sympathy with nominalists than with realists (in the medieval sense).
>   As far as possible they try to avoid any reference to abstract entities and to 
>   restrict themselves to what is sometimes called a nominalistic language, i.e.,
>   one not containing such references. [^Carnap1950p1]

[^Russell1945p834]: @Russell_1945_A_History_of_Western_Philosophy\, p. 834.

Positivists have instrumentalist (anti-realist) views about the models science
produces, given that they are constructed from abstractions and involve the
epistemological limitations of induction and theory change. As a qualified sort
of empiricism that supports the primacy of the scientific method, positivism
is sometimes equated with scientism (often derogatorily) if one takes it to
claim that science is the only way to attain knowledge.

In a more general sense, positivism is aligned with naturalism, the
meta-philosophy that roughly says that science should inform and bootstrap
our philosophical claims. Naturalists, having a more broadly aligned and
various support for science, may not have such exclusive views of
epistemology or such eliminative views of metaphysics. Many naturalists are
instead realists about science, math, and/or ethics, for example following
a version of structural realism about the discoveries from science, capturing
and constraining real structures in nature.

Comte on the unknowability of the composition of stars:

>   On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible
>   to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can
>   conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their
>   motions, we shall never be able by any means to study their chemical composition
>   or their mineralogical structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous
>   envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive
>   power, we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition
>   or even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean
>   temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. [^Comte1835stars]

### Postpositivism

A metatheoretical stance that critiques and amends positivism. While positivists believe that the researcher and the researched person are independent of each other, postpositivists accept that theories, background, knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed. They believe that human knowledge is based not on unchallengeable, rock-solid foundations, but rather upon human conjectures.

-   Karl Popper (1902-1994)
    -   *falsifiability* over *verifiability*
    -   a turn towards realism
    -   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.
-   Willard Van Orman Quine (1908-2000)
    -   Quine's "Two Dogmas"[^Quine-1951]
        1.  analytic-synthetic distinction
        2.  reductionism (verification theory of meaning)
    -   Duhem-Quine thesis
    -   inscrutability of reference
-   Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996)
    -   paradigm shifts

>   Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories---the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences---are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.) Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories. [^Popper1963]

[^Popper1963]: @Popper_1963_Conjectures_and_Refutations_The_Growth\, p. XXX.

The "death" of positivism:

-   anti-positivism, post-structuralism, postmodernism (continental)

Later Wittgenstein:

-   @Wittgenstein_2009_Philosophical_Investigations\. *Philosophical Investigations*.
-   Ordinary language philosophy
-   Instrumentalist and somewhat pragmatist
-   An imprtant project is to understand the differences between early (*TLP*)
    and late (*PI*) Wittgenstein. It is quite the about-face.
    -   TLP: Language has a structure that can be mapped onto (meaning) the logical structure of the world
    -   PI: The meaning of a word is its use.

Wittgenstein in *PI*:

>   Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language.


### Pragmatism

-   anti-realist
-   Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914)
-   William James (1842-1910)
-   John Dewey (1859-1952)
-   later Wittgenstein
-   Rorty and Putnam
-   Quine
-   Dennett
-   Our confidence comes in continuous amounts.
    We might as well act as if a claim with a certain confidence
    is real, however, we really deny realism.
-   Meaning is rooted in use.
-   Uniquely American philosophical movement.


### Postmodernism

-   anti-realist, relativism
-   Incommensurability
-   Conventionalism
-   Postmodernism
    -   Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard (1924-1998)
    -   Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995)
    -   Michel Foucault (1926-1984)
    -   Jacques Derrida (1930-2004)
-   Social constructivism
    -   Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996)
    -   Imre Lakatos (1922-1974)
    -   Paul Feyerabend (1924-1994)
    -   Larry  Laudan (b. 1941)
-   Epistemological anarchism
-   [How French "intellectuals" ruined the West: postmodernism and its impact, explained](https://areomagazine.com/2017/03/27/how-french-intellectuals-ruined-the-west-postmodernism-and-its-impact-explained/)
    -   Ryan: Resonating, going viral, does not indicate that it's true or good for progress.
    -   Ryan: I've been wanting to write an essay in this vein for years, and this author is better equipped to explain postmodernism than I. This argument could still be further buttressed with a brief history of the Enlightenment carrying empiricism and liberalism. Today there are still empiricist / naturalist / structuralist / realist / pragmatist ways of viewing the world that reject relativism and recognize some objectivity in the truth of claims about the world, be them descriptive or normative. There are better more accurate ways of describing the world and what one should do than others.
    -   Ryan: It also irritates me that so many people are introduced to continental philosophy, including postmodernism, as if that's the end of philosophy.

### Constructive empiricism

Science aims to give us theories that are empirically adequate,
but does not justify metaphysical claims about reality.

-   anti-realist
-   van Fraassen, Bueno
-   van Fraassen's "Arguments Concerning Scientific Realism"[^van-Fraassen-1980]
-   Unlike positivism/instrumentalism, theories should be taken literally.

### Feminist epistemology

-   Situated knowers
-   Feminist standpoint theory
-   intersectionality


### Critical realism

Critical realists believe that there are unobservable events which cause the
observable ones; as such, the social world can be understood only if people
understand the structures that generate such unobservable events.

-   realist

### Active realism

-   Hasok Chang


My thoughts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, I plan to summarize my thoughts after finishing the analysis of
several sources below.

Ways to phrase the issue:

-   Does your worldview have commitments to ontologies claimed to be part of reality?
-   Is the goal of science to describe reality?  Does science make any progress at that?

Misc.:

-   Relation to naturalism and mathematical realism.
-   We should remind ourselves that independent of our debate, the world is doing
    something in certain ways and not in others.

Questions:

-   Is there a position that requires *any* element of a good scientific theory to
    be interpretable?  What would that mean?
-   Maybe scientism is really the same thing positivism re-branded;
    similarly, naturalism is empiricism re-branded.

### Carnap, R. (1950). Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology.

-   @Carnap_1950_Empiricism_semantics_and_ontology

#### 1. The problem of abstract entities

-   Empiricists tend to prefer to restrict themselves to
    *nominalistic language* -- without containing references to abstract entities.
-   Formalists view mathematics as a mechanistic calculus without interpretation,
    but physics seems to lend its own interpretation.

>   In physics it is more difficult to shun the suspected entities because the language
>   of physics serves for the communication of reports and predictions and hence
>   cannot be taken as a mere calculus.

-   A physicist may declare some parts of a theory as uninterpretable.
-   Carnap says his purpose is to clarify that *empiricists can accept a
    language referring to abstract entities without embracing platonic ontologies*.

#### 2. Linguistic frameworks

-   Carnap defines *linguistic frameworks*, *internal* vs *external* questions
    (internal to the framework or about the metaphysical world),
    and the *world of things*.

>   To recognize something as a real thing or event means to succeed in
>   incorporating it into the system of things at a particular space-time
>   position so that it fits together with the other things as real,
>   according to the rules of the framework.

-   Carnap distinguishes that only the philosopher
    (not the man on the street nor the scientist)
    asks the external questions about reality outside the linguistic framework.
-   Carnap goes on about what it means to accept the *thing language*.
    The system can be constructed by introducing new language expressions
    (as a sequence of `typedef`s, as he seems to mean).

#### 3. What does acceptance of a kind of entities mean?

#### 4. Abstract entities in semantics

#### 5. Conclusion

#### My thoughts

-   Sometimes I feel like Carnap repeats his theses though as if that helps support them.
    He says over and over that accepting a thing in a language is practical matter,
    not a theoretical/metaphysical one, which I agree with to a degree.
    But then that leaves us on the edge of a lot of semantic cliffs,
    saying "but what do our abstract entities mean?", or rather,
    "what does their scientific success mean?".
-   In the end, my impression is that I'm still not satisfied with nominalism.
    I feel like the road to addressing Carnap, the issues he should have acknowledged,
    is that some of our abstract classes are *super fucking natural*.
    The success of some instances of our abstract internal languages
    should lead one, through the same methods of scientific inference that we do
    within the internal language,
    to do *abduction to natural kinds* in the external world.
    To deny the likely success of that abduction is to plead that there is a conspiracy.
