Scientific realism
================================================================================

Can we claim to know anything about reality?
Is it a goal of science to describe reality?
Does science make any progress at describing reality?
This outline focuses on the issues of *metaphysical* progress
from science, while the 
[Outline on the scientific method](scientific-method.html)
discusses the epistemological foundations and limitations of science.

Metaphysics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When one encounters the word "metaphysics", what is usually meant is one of the
three following ideas:

-   What *really* exists, or at least what exist literally beyond what we know
    in physics.  This is one of the oldest and fundamental branches in philosophy.
    In a naturalist sense, high-energy theoretical physics can be seen as
    examples of theoretical metaphysics at its best, ideas about about what
    there exists at a more fundamental level based on what we know at more
    pedestrian levels of experience.
-   A pejorative word, denoting ideas that are meaningless because they are
    claims beyond what is verifiable.  This was the view of the positivistists.
-   A loosely, if ill-defined, woo-woo word in which a mystic, guru, or metaphysician
    may claim to specialize.

Russell:

>   [T]he attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means of thought.

van Inwagen:

>   The word 'metaphysics' is derived from a collective title of the fourteen books by
>   Aristotle that we currently think of as making up Aristotle's *Metaphysics*.
>   Aristotle himself did not know the word. (He had four names for the branch of
>   philosophy that is the subject-matter of Metaphysics: 'first philosophy', 
>   'first science', 'wisdom', and 'theology'.) At least one hundred years after
>   Aristotle's death, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of Rhodes) 
>   titled those fourteen books "*Ta meta ta phusika*"---"the after the physicals" or 
>   "the ones after the physical ones"---the "physical ones" being the books contained
>   in what we now call Aristotle's *Physics*. The title was probably meant to warn
>   students of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt Metaphysics only after
>   they had mastered "the physical ones", the books about nature or the natural
>   world. [^vanInwagen2014]

Stealing from encyclopedia.com:

>   In medieval and modern philosophy "metaphysics" has also been taken to mean the study
>   of things transcending nature---that is, existing separately from nature and having
>   more intrinsic reality and value than the things of nature---giving *meta*
>   a philosophical meaning it did not have in classical Greek.
>   
>   Especially since Immanuel Kant metaphysics has often meant a priori speculation on
>   questions that cannot be answered by scientific observation and experiment.
>   Popularly, "metaphysics" has meant anything abstruse and highly theoretical---a common
>   eighteenth-century usage illustrated by David Hume's occasional use of metaphysical to
>   mean "excessively subtle". The term has also been popularly associated with the spiritual,
>   the religious, and even the occult. In modern philosophical usage metaphysics refers
>   generally to the field of philosophy dealing with questions about the kinds of things
>   there are and their modes of being. Its subject matter includes the concepts of existence,
>   thing, property, event; the distinctions between particulars and universals,
>   individuals and classes; the nature of relations, change, causation; and the nature of mind,
>   matter, space, and time.

### Early modern skepticism

-   Many philosophers in that Early Modern Period had threads of Idealism (wikipedia: reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core). *e.g.* George Berkeley, Kant, Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
-   Descartes' demon


### Modern skepticism

-   "Here is one hand" - Moore [^Moore1925]
-   "On Certainty" - Wittgenstein
-   The map and the territory

Korzybski:

>   A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. [^Korzybski1933p58]

Borges:

>   **On Exactitude in Science**
>
>   ... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

Instrumentalism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With realism and antirealism being one of the oldest dichotomies of positions
in philosophy, a way of classifying the tension in more recent philosophy is
between *instrumentalism* and *scientific realism*, each with many varieties.
First let's look at instrumentalism.

### First pass

Theoretical concepts may have use in predicting observations,
but we have no ontological commitments to them.

-   antirealist


### History

-   Duhem
-   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism): "Initially a novel perspective introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today." [^Torretti1999]
-   Later Wittgenstein in *PI*. See [Postpositivism](#postpositivism), below.

### Discussion

Redhead:

>   that there is something special about science and scientific method, and tries to

Positivism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   antirealist
-   nominalism

Positivism is a philosophy of science and epistemology that roughly defends a
qualified empiricism, that the scientific method is the only route to knowledge,
and that all statements that cannot be empirically verified are meaningless.
Positivism is strongly eliminative about metaphysics and claims that many
metaphysical questions and positions are not open or false, but meaningless
because of their lack of attachment to empirically demonstrable things or effects.

Google:

>   Logical positivism: a form of positivism, developed by members of the
>   Vienna Circle, that considers that the only meaningful philosophical
>   problems are those that can be solved by logical analysis.

Chakravartty:

>   According to the best known, traditional form of instrumentalism, terms
>   for unobservables have no meaning all by themselves; construed literally,
>   statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity
>   (cf. a more recent proposal in Rowbottom 2011). The most influential

>   including Carnap and Hempel, famously associated with the Vienna Circle
>   group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors

>   adopted a non-literal semantics according to which these terms acquire
>   meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example,
>   "electron" might mean "white streak in a cloud chamber"), or with
>   demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called "operationalism").
>   Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately
>   (in large measure) to the demise of logical empiricism and the growth of
>   realism. The contrast here is not merely in semantics and epistemology: a
>   number of logical empiricists also held the neo-Kantian view that
>   ontological questions "external" to the frameworks for knowledge
>   represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is
>   made solely on pragmatic grounds), thereby rejecting the metaphysical
>   dimension of realism (as in Carnap 1950). [^Chakravartty2017]

This means that positivism is generally seen to imply antirealist views of
science and mathematics, preferring as Carnap says in
"Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology":

>   Empiricists are in general rather suspicious with respect to any kind of abstract 
>   entities like properties, classes, relations, numbers, propositions, etc. 
>   They usually feel much more in sympathy with nominalists than with realists (in the medieval sense).
>   As far as possible they try to avoid any reference to abstract entities and to 
>   restrict themselves to what is sometimes called a nominalistic language, i.e.,
>   one not containing such references. [^Carnap1950p1]

Positivists have instrumentalist (antirealist) views about the models science
produces, given that they are constructed from abstractions and involve the
epistemological limitations of induction and theory change. As a qualified sort
of empiricism that supports the primacy of the scientific method, positivism
is sometimes equated with scientism (often derogatorily) if one takes it to
claim that science is the only way to attain knowledge.

>   If we say, as was frequently said of old, that metaphysics is the theory
>   of "true being", of "reality in itself", of "transcendent being" this
>   obviously implies a (contradictory), spurious, lesser, apparent
>   being; as has indeed been assumed by all metaphysicians since the time
>   of Plato and the Eleatics. This apparent being is the realm of
>   "appearances", and while the true transcendent reality is to be reached
>   only with difficulty, by the efforts of the metaphysician, the special
>   sciences have to do exclusively with appearances which are perfectly
>   accessible to them. The contrast in cognizability of these two "modes
>   of being" is then explained by the fact that the appearances are
>   immediately known, "given", to us, while metaphysical reality must be
>   inferred from them in some roundabout manner. And thus we seem
>   to arrive at a fundemental concept of the positivists, for they always
>   speak of the "given", and usually formulate their fundamental principle
>   in the proposition that the philosopher as well as the scientist must
>   always remain within the given, that to go beyond it, as the metaphysician
>   attempts, is impossible or senseless. [^Schlick1948p479]

In a more general sense, positivism is aligned with naturalism, the
meta-philosophy that roughly says that science should inform and bootstrap
our philosophical claims. Naturalists, having a more broadly aligned and
various support for science, may not have such exclusive views of
epistemology or such eliminative views of metaphysics. Many naturalists are
instead realists about science, math, and/or ethics, for example following
a version of structural realism about the discoveries from science, capturing
and constraining real structures in nature.

-   Comte and Mill

Comte on the unknowability of the composition of stars:

>   On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible
>   to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can
>   conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their

>   or their mineralogical structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous
>   envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive
>   power, we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition
>   or even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean
>   temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. [^Comte1835stars]

-   [The linguistic turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn)

Wittgenstein studied with, was influenced by, and influenced:

-   Bertrand Russell & Afred North Whitehead
    -   *Principia Mathematica* (1910)
-   George Edward Moore

>   *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* [is] the only philosophy book that Wittgenstein
>   published during his lifetime. It claimed to solve all the major problems
>   of philosophy and was held in especially high esteem by the anti-metaphysical
>   logical positivists. The *Tractatus* is based on the idea that philosophical
>   problems arise from misunderstandings of the logic of language, and it tries
>   to show what this logic is. Wittgenstein's later work, principally his
>   *Philosophical Investigations*, shares this concern with logic and language,
>   but takes a different, less technical, approach to philosophical problems.
>   This book helped to inspire so-called ordinary language philosophy. [^Richter2004]

*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1922) [^Wittgenstein1922]

-   The picture theory of meaning
    -   Correspondence theory of truth?
-   Logical atomism
    -   Analyticity
-   Verifiability and quietism
    -   Anti-metaphysics that impressed the logical postivists

-   Video: Ian Ground, Stephen Mulhall, & Chon Tejedor. (2018). [The Young Wittgenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE4dDqUTnaA).
-   Wittgenstein's *Tractatus* was read by and greatly influenced The Vienna Circle.
    While Wittgenstein had relations with them, he never participated in the meetings
    lead by Schlick. (TODO:ref)
-   TODO: While the *Tractatus* does focus on verifiability as an anti-metaphysical
    criterion, it doesn't seem that he ever identified with positivism.
-   TODO: Most consider Wittgenstein's early views to follow a kind of logicism
    that is ultimately anti-realist; but to me, there appears to be an interpretation
    of that Wittgenstein's early views of structure that ultimately
    follow some kind of platonism, the correspondence theory of truth, and a sense
    of realism.

### Logical positivism and the Vienna Circle

-   Vienna circle [^Murzi2004]
-   Group of philosophers lead by Moritz Schlick that met regularly at the University of Vienna from 1924 to 1936.
-   Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Kurt G&ouml;del, Victor Kraft, Otto Neurath, Friedrich Waismann, Gustav Bergmann, and others.
-   Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper corresponded with the circle but did not attend.
-   Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung: Der Wiener Kreis - Scientific Worldview: The Vienna Circle (1929) [^Hahn1973]
    -   The Vienna Circle's manifesto
-   Carnap: *The Logical Structure of the World* (1928) - (*Der Logische Aufbau der Welt*) [^Carnap1928]
-   In 1930 the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle took over the journal *Annalen der Philosophie*
    and made it the main journal of logical empiricism under the title *Erkenntnis*,
    edited by Carnap and Reichenbach.
-   A.J. Ayer (1910-1989): *Language, Truth, and Logic* (1936) [^Ayer1936]
-   *International Encyclopedia of Unified Science*
    -   Only the first section *Foundations of the Unity of Science*, in two volumes, was ever published between 1938 and 1969.
-   Schlick & Rynin. (1948). "Positivism and realism" [^Schlick1948]
-   The murder of Schlick in 1936 by a former student put an end to the Vienna Circle in Austria.

### Logical empiricism and the Berlin Circle

-   Hans Reichenbach (1891-1953)
-   In 1928, Reichenbach founded the Berlin Circle, which was called *Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie* (*Society for Empirical Philosophy*).
-   Carl Gustav Hempel, Richard von Mises, David Hilbert, and Kurt Grelling
-   Logical empiricism - Creathe [^Creathe2011]

-   Carnap: "Testibility and Meaning" (1936-7) [^Carnap1937]
    -   Argued to replace verification with confirmation.
    -   Carnap spent many years trying to develop a theory of degree of confirmation
        but was never able to satisfactorily formulate a model. [^Murzi2001]
-   Reichenbach emigrated to the US in 1938 and became a professor at UCLA.
-   Carnap joined UCLA in 1954, the year after Reichenbach died.
-   TODO: Quine on how huge Carnap's influence is. [^Quine1990-3]

Russell:

>   Modern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume 
>   by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical 
>   technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite 
>   answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has

>   at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, 
>   resemble those of science. [^Russell1945p834]

On logical empiricism and Reichenbach at UCLA:

>   Part of the movement's legacy lies in contemporary philosophy of science.
>   In the US nearly all philosophers of science can trace their academic
>   lineages to Reichenbach. Most were either his students or students of his
>   students and so on. His scientific realism inspired a generation of
>   philosophers, even those clearly outside the movement. Even the reaction
>   against various forms of realism that have appeared in recent decades have
>   roots in the logical empiricist movement. Moreover, philosophers of science
>   are expected to know a great deal of the science about which they
>   philosophize and to be cautious in telling practicing scientists what
>   concepts they may or may not use. In these respects and others contemporary
>   philosophers promote a kind of naturalism, and by so doing they follow
>   both the precept and the example of the logical empiricists. [^Creathe2011]

and

>   Among his many students were Hempel, Putnam, and W. Salmon, and so almost
>   all philosophy of science in the US can trace its academic lineage to
>   Reichenbach. Though interested in social and educational reform, he worked
>   primarily in philosophy of physics. He developed and defended a frequency
>   theory of probability, and emphasized both scientific realism and the
>   importance of causality and causal laws. [^Creathe2011]

### The "death" of positivism

-   anti-positivism, Kuhn, Popper
-   post-structuralism, postmodernism (continental)
-   In 1967 John Passmore reported that: "Logical positivism, then,
    is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes." [^Passmore1967]
-   Ayer, A.J. 
-   Hemple (1950) [^Hemple1950]

Ayer:

>   The most important defect was that nearly all of it was false. [^Ayer1978]

Much ado is made about positivism being "dead", but its influence is still
promenent over philosophy and the structure of societies.

Friedman:

>   Carnap's influence, in particular, also extended much further: to the
>   widespread application of logical and mathematical methods to philosophical
>   problems more generally, especially in semantics and the philosophy of
>   language. Indeed, as is well known, the ideas of the logical positivists
>   exerted a very substantial influence well beyond the boundaries of
>   professional philosophy, particularly in psychology and the social sciences.
>   It is not too much to say, therefore, that twentieth-century intellectual life
>   would be simply uncrecognizable without the deep and pervasive current of

### Realist turn

-   a turn towards realism
-   Poincar&eacute;
    -   structure
-   Reichenbach
-   Karl Popper (1902-1994)
    -   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.
    -   *falsifiability* over *verifiability*
-   Sellars
-   Putnam, NMA
-   Sankey [^Sankey2015]
-   Talk by Sankey: [Scepticism, Relativism and Naturalistic Particularism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyEFaJf_Dyo)
    -   Chisholm's particularism: start with what is uncontroversially known.
        Justify epistemic standards second. It's ok to question beg.

Popper:

>   Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories---the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences---are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.) Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories.

Constructive empiricism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Science aims to give us theories that are empirically adequate,
but does not justify metaphysical claims about reality.

-   Henri Poincar&eacute;

Poincar&eacute;:

>   [W]hat is objective must be common to many minds and consequently transmissible from one to the other. ...
>   [P]ure quality ... is intransmissible... . But it is not the same with relations...

Critical realism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Critical realists believe that there are unobservable events which cause the
observable ones; as such, the social world can be understood only if people
understand the structures that generate such unobservable events.

My thoughts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, I plan to summarize my thoughts after finishing the analysis of
several sources below.

Ways to phrase the issue:

-   Does your worldview have commitments to ontologies claimed to be part of reality?
-   Is the goal of science to describe reality?  Does science make any progress at that?

Misc.:

-   Relation to naturalism and mathematical realism.
-   We should remind ourselves that independent of our debate, the world is doing
    something in certain ways and not in others.

Questions:

-   Is there a position that requires *any* element of a good scientific theory to
    be interpretable?  What would that mean?
-   Maybe scientism is really the same thing positivism re-branded;
    similarly, naturalism is empiricism re-branded.

### Carnap, R. (1950). Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology.

-   @Carnap_1950_Empiricism_semantics_and_ontology

#### 1. The problem of abstract entities

-   Empiricists tend to prefer to restrict themselves to
    *nominalistic language* -- without containing references to abstract entities.
-   Formalists view mathematics as a mechanistic calculus without interpretation,
    but physics seems to lend its own interpretation.

>   In physics it is more difficult to shun the suspected entities because the language
>   of physics serves for the communication of reports and predictions and hence
>   cannot be taken as a mere calculus.

-   A physicist may declare some parts of a theory as uninterpretable.
-   Carnap says his purpose is to clarify that *empiricists can accept a
    language referring to abstract entities without embracing platonic ontologies*.

#### 2. Linguistic frameworks

-   Carnap defines *linguistic frameworks*, *internal* vs *external* questions
    (internal to the framework or about the metaphysical world),
    and the *world of things*.

>   To recognize something as a real thing or event means to succeed in
>   incorporating it into the system of things at a particular space-time
>   position so that it fits together with the other things as real,
>   according to the rules of the framework.

-   Carnap distinguishes that only the philosopher
    (not the man on the street nor the scientist)
    asks the external questions about reality outside the linguistic framework.
-   Carnap goes on about what it means to accept the *thing language*.
    The system can be constructed by introducing new language expressions
    (as a sequence of `typedef`s, as he seems to mean).

#### 3. What does acceptance of a kind of entities mean?

#### 4. Abstract entities in semantics

#### 5. Conclusion

#### My thoughts

-   Sometimes I feel like Carnap repeats his theses though as if that helps support them.
    He says over and over that accepting a thing in a language is practical matter,
    not a theoretical/metaphysical one, which I agree with to a degree.
    But then that leaves us on the edge of a lot of semantic cliffs,
    saying "but what do our abstract entities mean?", or rather,
    "what does their scientific success mean?".
-   In the end, my impression is that I'm still not satisfied with nominalism.
    I feel like the road to addressing Carnap, the issues he should have acknowledged,
    is that some of our abstract classes are *super fucking natural*.
    The success of some instances of our abstract internal languages
    should lead one, through the same methods of scientific inference that we do
    within the internal language,
    to do *abduction to natural kinds* in the external world.
    To deny the likely success of that abduction is to plead that there is a conspiracy.
