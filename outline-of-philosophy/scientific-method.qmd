title: "The scientific method"
date: today
---


This outline discusses the history of science, 
the definition of the scientific method,
its central role in founding a scientific epistemology,
the demarcation of science from pseudoscience,
and other _**epistemological**_ topics concerning the methods
and philosophy of science. 
The metaphysical implications of science
are discussed in the [Outline on scientific realism](scientific-realism.html).

This could have been called the outline of "Epistemology".


History of science
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this first section, we briefly outline chronologically highlights in
the development of science, after which there are sections focusing on topics
in the epistemology of science,
starting with [rationalism vs empiricism](#rationalism-vs-empiricism).

Russell:

>   The Greeks contributed, it is true, something else which proved of
>   more permanent value to abstract thought: they discovered
>   mathematics and the art of deductive reasoning. Geometry, in
>   particular, is a Greek invention, without which modern science would
>   have been impossible. But in connection with mathematics the
>   one-sidedness of the Greek genius appears: it reasoned deductively from
>   what appeared self-evident, not inductively from what had been observed.
>   Its amazing successes in the employment of this method
>   misled not only the ancient world, but the greater part of the modern
>   world also. It has only been very slowly that scientific method, which
>   seeks to reach principles inductively from observations of particular
>   facts, has replaced the Hellenic belief in deduction from luminous
>   axioms derived from the mind of the philosopher. For this reason,
>   apart from others, it is a mistake to treat the Greeks with
>   superstitious reverence. Scientific method, though some few among
>   them were the first men who had an inkling of it, is, on the whole, alien
>   to their temper of mind, and the attempt to glorify them by belittling
>   the intellectual progress of the last four centuries has a cramping
>   effect upon modern thought.
>   
>   There is however, a more general argument against reverence,
>   whether for the Greeks or for anyone else. In studying a philosopher,
>   the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of
>   hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to
>   believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude,
>   which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a
>   person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt
>   interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the
>   second. [^Russell1946p47]

Weinberg:

>   Like modern scientists, these early Greeks were willing to look beneath
>   the surface appearance of the world, pursuing knowledge about a deeper
>   level of reality. The matter of the world does not appear at first glance
>   as if it is all made of water, or air, or earth, or fire, or all four
>   together, or even atoms. [^Weinberg2015p7]

>   Nevertheless, I think one should not overemphasize the modern aspects
>   of Archaic or Greek science. There is an important feature of modern
>   science that is almost completely missing in all the thinkers I have
>   mentioned, from Thales to Plato: none of them attempted to verify or
>   even (aside perhaps from Zeno) seriously to justify their speculations.
>   In reading their writings, one continually wants to ask, "How do you know?"
>   This is just as true of Democritus as of others. Nowhere in the fragments
>   of his books that survive do we see any effort to show that matter
>   really is composed of atoms. [^Weinberg2015p11]

>   This did not occur to the early Greeks, or to many of their successors,
>   for a very simple reason: *they had never seen it done*. [^Weinberg2015p13]

>   To begin with clear and self-evident principles, to advance by timorous and
>   sure steps, to review frequently our conclusions, and examine accurately all
>   their consequences; though by these means we shall make both a slow and a
>   short progress in our systems; are the only methods, by which we can ever
>   hope to reach truth, and attain a proper stability and certainty in our
>   determinations. [^Hume2007p109]

Knowledge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Definining knowledge

Plato:

-   Knowledge is power [^RepublicV477]
-   Perception is _not_ knowledge [^Theaetetus186]

>   I myself do not have the answer when I perplex others, but I am more
>   perplexed than anyone when I cause perplexity in others. So now I do not
>   know what virtue is; perhaps you knew before you contacted me, but now you
>   are certainly like one who does not know. Nevertheless, I want to examine
>   and seek together with you what it may be. [^Meno80d]

-   According to Plato, all knowledge is found through recollection.
    -   My tweet: [Meno in a nutshell](https://twitter.com/RyanDavidReece/status/1475182905878093826)
    -   Fraser, Ed. (2012). [Picking a fight with Plato](https://philosophynow.org/issues/90/Picking_A_Fight_With_Plato).
-   Knowledge = Justified True Belief (JTB)

>   SOCRATES: Then suppose a jury has been justly persuaded of some matter which
>   only an eye-witness could know, and which cannot otherwise be
>   known; suppose they come to their decision upon hearsay, forming a true
>   judgment: then they have decided the case without knowledge, but, granted
>   they did their job well, being correctly persuaded?
>   
>   THEAETETUS: Yes, certainly.
>   
>   SOCRATES: But, my dear lad, they couldn't have done that if true judgment
>   is the same thing as knowledge; in that case the best juryman in the world
>   couldn't form a correct judgment without knowledge. So it seems they must
>   be different things.
>   
>   THEAETETUS: Oh, yes, Socrates, that's just what I once heard a man say;
>   I had forgotten, but now it's coming back to me. He said that it is true
>   judgment with an account that is knowledge; true judgment without an
>   account falls outside of knowledge. And he said that the things of which
>   there is no account are not knowable (yes, he actually called them that),
>   while those which have an account are knowable.
>   
>   SOCRATES: Very good indeed. [^Theaetetus201b]

![Knowledge = JTB - G ([philosophy-in-figures.tumblr.com](http://philosophy-in-figures.tumblr.com/post/90253498641/knowledge-jtb-g), 2014).](img/knowledge.png){#fig-knowledge-jtb-g}

In his unfinished work, *Rules* [^DescartesRule2], Descartes defines “science” (scientia) in Rule 2 as

>   *Omnis scientia est cognitio certa et evidens*.          
>   All (scientific) knowledge is certain and evident cognition.

In the same section, Descartes' boldly declares to reject probable knowledge
for only what is perfectly certain:

>   we reject all [...] merely probable cognition and resolve to believe
>   only what is perfectly known and incapable of being doubted.

-   Chisholm, R. (1966). *Theory of Knowledge*. [^Chisholm1966]
    -   The Problem of Criterion
-   Nozick, R. (1981). *Philosophical Explanations*. [^Nozick1981]

Ichikawa & Jenkins:

>   The standard analysis of knowledge says that for any subject $S$ and any
>   proposition $p$, the following are individually necessary and jointly
>   sufficient conditions for $S$ knows that $p$:
>   
>   1. $p$
>   2. $S$ believes that $p$
>   3. $S$ is justified in believing that $p$.
>   
>   Precursors of this view are sometimes attributed to Plato, who says in the
>   *Men*o that knowledge is distinguished from mere true belief in being
>   'tied down', so that it cannot easily escape or be lost as mere true belief
>   can. Views more closely resembling the above formulation of the JTB analysis
>   are attributed by Edmund Gettier to Roderick Chisholm and A. J. Ayer.
>   Neither of those authors phrased their conditions for knowledge exactly
>   this way. The now-usual formulation, in terms of justification, is so in
>   large part because of Gettier (1963). [^Ichikawa2017]

>   as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows,
>   when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause
>   of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other
>   than it is. [^PosteriorAnalyticsBook1ch2Mure]

another translation:

>   We think we understand something simpliciter (and not in the
>   sophistical way, incidentally) when we think we know of the
>   explanation because of which the object holds that it is its
>   explanation, and also that it is not possible for it to be otherwise.
>   It is plain, then, that to understand is something of this
>   sort. [^PosteriorAnalyticsBook1ch2Barnes]

-   Kant
    -   *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781)
    -   Are there synthetic a priori statements? Kant thinks so.
    -   Kant argues that all of pure mathematics is synthetic a priori,
        even in the simple example "7 + 5 = 12", since the concept of
        "12" is not contained in the concepts of "7", "5", or "+". [^Kant1787pB15]
    -   Transcendental Deduction of the Categories (TDC):
        An argument that aims to justify the use of a concept,
        one that demonstrates that the concept correctly applies to objects of experience.

Kant in his *Critique of Pure Reason* (1787):

>   In all judgments in which we think the relation of a subject to the predicate...
>   this relation is possible in two ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the
>   subject A as something that is (covertly) contained in this concept A;
>   or B, though connected with concept A, lies quite outside it.
>   In the first case I call the judgment _analytic_; in the second, _synthetic_.
>   Hence (affirmative) analytic judgments are those in which the predicate's
>   connection with the subject is thought by [thinking] identity, whereas those
>   judgments in which this connection is thought without [thinking] identity are
>   to be called synthetic. Analytic judgments could also be called _elucidatory_.
>   For they do not through the predicate add anything to the concept of the subject;
>   rather, they only dissect the concept, breaking it up into its component concepts
>   which had already been thought in it (although thought confusedly).
>   Synthetic judgments, on the other hand, could also be called _expansive_.
>   For they do add to the concept of the subject a predicate that had not been
>   thought in that concept at all and could not have been extracted from it
>   by any dissection. [^Kant1787pB10]

and

>   logic is a science that provides nothing but a comprehensive
>   exposition. [^Kant1787pBviii]

and

>   Now the proper problem of pure reason is contained in
>   this question:              
>   **How are synthetic judgments possible a priori?** [^Kant1787pB19]

Moore:

>   It is a well-known fact in the history of philosophy that necessary
>   truths in general, but especially those of which it is said that the
>   opposite is inconceivable, have been commonly supposed to be analytic,
>   in the sense that the proposition denying them was self-contradictory.
>   It was in this way, commonly supposed, before Kant, that many truths
>   could be proved by the law of contradiction alone. [^Moore1903p6]

Vienna Circle manifesto:

>   In such a way logical analysis overcomes not only metaphysics in the proper,
>   classical sense of the word, especially scholastic metaphysics and that of
>   the systems of German idealism, but also the hidden metaphysics of Kantian
>   and modern *apriorism*. The scientific world-conception knows no unconditionally
>   valid knowledge derived from pure reason, no 'synthetic judgments a priori'
>   of the kind that lie at the basis of Kantian epistemology and even more of
>   all pre- and post-Kantian ontology and metaphysics. The judgments of
>   arithmetic, geometry, and certain fundamental principles of physics,
>   that Kant took as examples of a priori knowledge will be discussed later.
>   It is precisely in the rejection of the possibility of synthetic knowledge
>   a priori that the basic thesis of modern empiricism lies. The scientific
>   world-conception knows only empirical statements about things of all kinds,
>   and analytic statements of logic and mathematics. [^Hahn1973Sec2a]

### Criticisms

Einstein:

>   As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
>   and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. [^Einstein1922pX]

and

>   I am even of the opinion that this standpoint
>   [Kant’s system of *a priori* concepts and norms]
>   cannot be strictly refuted by any scientific development. For, one will
>   always be able to say that critical philosophers had hitherto erred in
>   setting up the *a priori* elements and one will always be able to set up
>   a system of *a priori* elements that does not conflict with a given
>   physical system. I surely may briefly indicate why I do not find this
>   standpoint natural. Let a physical theory consist of the parts (elements)
>   $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, which together form a logical whole that correctly connects
>   the pertinent experiments (sensory experiences). Then the tendency is
>   that less than all four elements, e.g., $A$, $B$, $D$, still say nothing about
>   the experiences, *without* $C$; no more so $A$, $B$, $C$, without $D$. One is then free
>   to regard three of these elements, e.g., $A$, $B$, $C$, as *a priori* and only $D$ as
>   empirically determined. What always remains unsatisfactory in this is the
>   *arbitrariness* of the choice of elements to be designated as *a priori*, even
>   disregarding that the theory could be replaced at some point by another
>   theory that substitutes some of these elements (or all four of them) with

Induction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Problem of induction

-   How do we infer universals from particulars?
-   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
-   Fallacy: hasty generalization
-   *Ex ante* probability
-   Note that philosophical induction is not [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction).

Sextus Empiricus:

>   When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, 
>   they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. 
>   But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the 
>   particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; 
>   while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, 
>   since the particulars are infinite and indefinite. [^SextusEmpiricus]

Leibniz:

>   The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge,
>   are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never
>   give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual
>   truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however
>   numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal
>   necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened
>   before will happen in the same way again... And any one who believed
>   that [day must follow night] is a necessary and eternal truth which
>   will last for ever, would likewise be wrong, since we must hold that
>   the earth and even the sun do not exist of necessity, and that there
>   may perhaps come a time when that beautiful star and its whole system
>   will exist no longer, at least in its present form. 
>   From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure
>   mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have
>   principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently
>   on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would
>   never have occurred to us to think of them. [^Leibniz1996pX]

Hume:

>   Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable.
>   In this view, we must say, that it is only probable that all men must die,
>   or that the sun will rise tomorrow.
>   But to conform our language more to common use,
>   we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs,
>   and probabilities---by proofs meaning such arguments from experience as
>   leave no room for doubt or opposition. [^Hume2007p56]

### Inductive logic

Newton:

>   In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induction
>   should be considered exactly or very nearly true not withstanding any contrary
>   hypothesis, until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more exact
>   or liable to exceptions. [^NewtonpX]

-   Thomas Bayes (1701-1761)
-   Richard Price (1723-1791)
-   Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827)
-   William Whewell (1794-1866)
    -   *Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences* (1840)
    -   Discussed in Aronson [^Aronson2007]
-   John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
    -   *A System of Logic* (1843) [^Mill1843]
-   Charles S. Peirce (1839-1914)

Price knew the work of Bayes well. Concerning Bayes'
"An Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances" (1763),
    
>   It was on this essay, and on an Appendix which Price himself authored,
>   that Price drew in fashioning his critique of Hume's "Of Miracles".
>   In *Four Dissertations*, Price gives a reference to Bayes' paper.
>   But it is doubtful that Hume read the paper, and even if he had it
>   is even more doubtful that Hume would have understood it because he
>   was unfamiliar with the technical developments in the probability calculus.
>   
>   Is it then fair to use this apparatus as part of a critique of Hume's
>   argument against miracles? My answer is an unqualified yes. In the
>   Abstract to the *Treatise*, Hume endorses Leibniz's complaint that
>   various authors, including Locke, are
>   "too concise when they treat of probabilities, and those other measures
>   of evidence on which life and action intirely depend, and which are our
>   guides even in most of our philosophical speculations."
>   The Abstract announces that
>   "The author of the treatise of human nature seems to have been sensible
>   of this defect in these philosophers, and has endeavoured, as much as
>   he can, to supply it" (T 647).
>   Of course, by "probabilities" Hume did not have in mind reasoning that
>   proceeds by proving and applying theorems of the probability calculus.
>   But ignorance of the apparatus is no excuse since, for example, before
>   the end of the seventeenth century, there were published attempts to
>   apply the probability calculus to some of the questions at issue in
>   Hume's essay, such as the effect of multiple witnesses.
>   A number of Hume's contemporaries, such as Price, understood Hume's
>   claims as being about quantifiable degrees of belief or credibility,
>   the quantification being subject to the constraints of the probability
>   calculus. [^Earman2000p25]

Vickers:

>   [I]n Peirce's phrase, inductions are _ampliative_. Induction can amplify and
>   generalize our experience, broaden and deepen our empirical knowledge.
>   Deduction on the other hand is explicative. Deduction orders and
>   rearranges our knowledge without adding to its content. [^Vickers2014]

Peirce on _merely_ the denial of any major failures of induction
and the wonderful self-correcting nature of ampliative inference:

Peirce:

>   I maintain that it has been shown that the modes of inference in question are
>   necessarily valid, whatever the constitution of the universe, so long as it
>   admits of the premises being true.
>   Yet I am willing to concede, in order to concede as much as possible,
>   that when a man draws instances at random, all that he knows is that he
>   _tries_ to follow a certain precept; so that the sampling process might be
>   rendered generally fallacious by the existence of a mysterious and malign
>   connection between the mind and the universe, such that the possession by an
>   object of an _unperceived_ character might influence the will toward choosing
>   it or rejecting it. Such a circumstance would, however, be as fatal to
>   deductive as to ampliative inference. Suppose, for example, that I were
>   to enter a great hall where people were playing _rouge et noir_ at many tables;
>   and suppose that I knew that the red and black were turned up with equal
>   frequency. Then, if I were to make a large number of mental bets with myself,
>   at this table and at that, I might, by statistical deduction, expect to win
>   about half of them, ---precisely as I might expect, from the results of these
>   samples, to infer by induction the probable ratio of frequency of the
>   turnings of red and black in the long run, if I did not know it.
>   But could some devil look at each card before it was turned, and then
>   influence me mentally to bet upon it or to refrain therefrom, the observed
>   ratio in the cases upon which I had bet might be quite different from the
>   observed ratio in those cases upon which I had not bet. I grant, then,
>   that even upon my theory some fact has to be supposed to make induction
>   and hypothesis valid processes; namely, it is supposed that the supernal powers
>   withhold their hands and let me alone, and that no mysterious uniformity or
>   adaptation interferes with the action of chance. But then this negative
>   fact supposed by my theory plays a totally different part from the facts
>   supposed to be requisite by the logicians of whom I have been speaking.
>   So far as facts like those they suppose can have any bearing,
>   they serve as major premises from which the fact inferred by induction or 
>   hypothesis might be deduced; while the negative fact supposed by me is
>   merely the denial of any major premise from which the falsity of the
>   inductive or hypothetic conclusion could in general be deduced.
>   Nor is it necessary to deny altogether the existence of mysterious
>   influences adverse to the validity of the inductive and hypothetic processes.
>   So long as their influence were not too over whelming, the wonderful
>   self-correcting nature of the ampliative inference would enable us,
>   even if they did exist, to detect and make allowance for them. [^Peirce1883p176]

Wikipedia:

>    Bhaskar also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate, located in the enduring nature of something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless. [^Bhaskar2008pX]

### First pass

Feynman:

>   [S]cience is a method of finding things out. This method is based on
>   the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is
>   so or not. All other aspects and characteristics of science can be
>   understood directly when we understand that observation is the ultimate
>   and final judge of the truth of an idea...
>   That is the principle of science. If there is an exception to any rule,
>   and it can be proved by observation, that rule is wrong. [^Feynman1998p15]

Feynman:

>   There are in science a number of technical consequences that follow from
>   the principle of observation as judge. For example, the observation
>   cannot be rough. You have to be very careful. There may have been a
>   piece of dirt in the apparatus that made the color change; it was not
>   what you thought. You have to check the observations very carefully,
>   and then recheck them, to be sure that you understand what all the

Wikipedia:

>   Grosseteste was the first of the Scholastics to fully understand Aristotle's
>   vision of the dual path of scientific reasoning: generalising from particular
>   observations into a universal law, and then back again from universal laws to
>   prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition".
>   So, for example, looking at the particulars of the moon, it is possible to
>   arrive at universal laws about nature. Conversely once these universal laws
>   are understood, it is possible to make predictions and observations about
>   other objects besides the moon. Grosseteste said further that both paths
>   should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles involved.

Models in science
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   TODO1: *priority section to finish*

### What's a model?

French:

>   [S]cientist *don't* simply deduce experimental/observational consequences;
>   they construct models that 'mediate' between theories and the observations.
>   There are a number of reasons why scientists will proceed in this way
>   but one is that theories are often quite complex and difficult to work with.
>   So a scientist may build a simplified model, containing significant
>   idealizations that allow the scientist to ignore certain factors,
>   for example, and [more] easily relate the theory to observations. [^French2007p81]

Holm:

>   Fermat's principle (that the light ray passing from one point to another in an
>   optical medium takes the path of stationary optical length) is complementary to
>   Huygens' principle (that a later wave front emerges as the envelope of wavelets
>   emitted from the present wave front). Both principles are only models of reality,
>   but they are models in the best sense. Both are transcendent fabrications that
>   intuited the results of a later, more fundamental principle (Maxwell's equations)
>   and gave accurate predictions at the level of physical perception in their time.
>   Without being the full truth by being physically tenable themselves, they
>   fulfilled the tasks for which they were developed and they laid the foundations
>   for more fundamental theories. Light rays do not exist and points along a
>   light wave do not emit light. However, both principles work quite well in the
>   design of optical instruments! In addition, both principles are still interesting
>   now as the mathematical definitions of rays and wave fronts, respectively,
>   although neither fully represents the physical principles of optics. [^Holm2011Ipxvi]

Model the theory:

$$ \text{Theory} + \text{Modeling} \longrightarrow \text{Model} $$

Fit the model to the data to make inferences on the theory:

$$ \text{Model} + \text{Data} + \text{Statistical Analysis} \longrightarrow \text{Model(improved)} \longrightarrow \text{Theory(improved)} $$

[^Holm2011Ipxvi]: @Holm_2011_Geometric_Mechanics_Part_I_Dynamics\, p. xvi.


### Models represent theories

Model the theory:

$$ T(\theta_k, \psi_m) \longrightarrow M(X_i | \theta_k, \nu_\ell) $$

Fit the model to the data to make inferences on the theory:

$$
    \{X_i\}_j
    \longrightarrow M(X_{ij} | \theta_k, \nu_\ell)
    \longrightarrow \hat{\theta}_k \pm \sigma_{\hat{\theta}_k} , \hat{\nu}_\ell \pm \sigma_{\hat{\nu}_\ell}
    \longrightarrow T(\hat{\theta}_k \pm \sigma_{\hat{\theta}_k}, \psi_m)
$$

Cox:

>   The very word *model* implies idealization of the real system and, except just
>   possibly in the more esoteric parts of modern physics ...
>   it hardly makes sense to talk of a model being true. [^Cox2006p84]

Frigg:

>   Morgan and Morrison (1999) rally around the idea that models are instruments
>   that mediate between theories and the world. Models are "autonomous agents"
>   in that they are independent from both theories and their target systems,
>   and it is this independence that allows them to mediate between the two.
>   Theories do not provide us with algorithms for the construction of a model;
>   they are not "vending machines" into which one can insert a problem and a
>   model pops out (Cartwright 1999). The construction of a model often requires
>   detailed knowledge about materials, approximation schemes, and the setup,
>   and these are not provided by the corresponding theory. Furthermore,
>   the inner workings of a model are often driven by a number of different
>   theories working cooperatively. In contemporary climate modeling,
>   for instance, elements of different theories---among them fluid dynamics,
>   thermodynamics, electromagnetism---are put to work cooperatively.
>   What delivers the results is not the stringent application of one theory,
>   but the voices of different theories when put to use in chorus with each
>   other in one model. [^Frigg2020]

### Digression: Some physicists have semantic differences

-   TODO: explain
-   HEP theorists especially
-   HEP theorists often use "theory" to mean "theoretical framework": quantum field theory, yang-mills theory, string theory, etc.
-   "Model building" in HEP means piecing together a particular theory, a "model", using a "theory" (theoretical framework).
-   The issue is purely semantic. The important point of the above discussion
    is that a model stands-in as a representative of a theory
    that can be compared with the data.

#### 1. Introduction

>   Do not become archivists of facts. Try to penetrate to the secret of their
>   occurrence, persistently search for the laws which govern them.

-- Ivan Pavlov

>   The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to
>   discover new ways of thinking about them.

-- W.L. Bragg

    -   "In other words, discovery is ultimately *irrational* and *unanalysable*."
-   Hypothetico-deductive account of discovery
    -   Hypotheses arrived at via creative Eureka moments.
    -   (Make a number of relevant observations.)
    -   Verification via deductive account of observations.
-   Inductive account of discovery
    -   (Hypotheses arrived at via creative Eureka moments.)
    -   Make a number of relevant observations.
    -   Inductively support hypotheses.
