Philosophy of mathematics
================================================================================

These next several outlines deal with philosophy of certain
specialized topics, starting with this one on the philosophy of mathematics.
Here we dig into issues of what is _abstraction_.

First we survey the following branches of mathematics:
logic, algebra, analysis, model theory.
Then we discuss unification programs across branches.
Followed by sections on positions in philosophy of mathematics,
in particular dealing with the realism/antirealism or platonism/nominalism
debate.

### Incompleteness

G&ouml;del, Kurt (1906-1978)

Goldstein [^Goldstein2005]

From Wikipedia:

G&ouml;del showed for that any formal system *S* powerful enough to represent arithmetic,
there is a theorem *G* which is true but the system is unable to prove.
*G* could be added as an additional axiom to the system in place of a proof.
However this would create a new system *S'* with its own unprovable true theorem *G'*,
and so on.

From Wikipedia:

-   The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an "effective procedure" (e.g., a computer program, but it could be any sort of algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the natural numbers.
-   The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that such a system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.
    Sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).
-   G&ouml;del's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a theory T1 satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any theory T2 that proves the consistency of T1. This is because such a theory T1 can prove that if T2 proves the consistency of T1, then T1 is in fact consistent. For the claim that T1 is consistent has form "for all numbers n, n has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in T1". If T1 were in fact inconsistent, then T2 would prove for some n that n is the code of a contradiction in T1. But if T2 also proved that T1 is consistent (that is, that there is no such n), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in T1 to show that if T2 is consistent, then T1 is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, T1 does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of T2 either.
-   The corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would actually provide no interesting information if a theory T proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of T in T would give us no clue as to whether T really is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of T would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a theory T in some theory T' that is in some sense less doubtful than T itself, for example weaker than T. For many naturally occurring theories T and T', such as T = Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and T' = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of T' is provable in T, and thus T' can't prove the consistency of T by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.
-   The second incompleteness theorem does not rule out consistency proofs altogether, only consistency proofs that could be formalized in the theory that is proved consistent. For example, Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic (PA) in a different theory that includes an axiom asserting that the ordinal called $\varepsilon_0$ is wellfounded; see Gentzen's consistency proof. Gentzen's theorem spurred the development of ordinal analysis in proof theory.

-   von Neumann recognized the importance first.
-   G&ouml;del was a platonist, a (religious) realist.

Yanofsky, N.S. (2016). Why mathematics works so well:

>   When you have two distinct fields of mathematics and they are shown to be
>   intimately related in a way that results of one field can be used to get
>   results of another field, you have a type of unification. An example of
>   such unification is monstrous moonshine. This subject describes the
>   shocking connection between the monster group and modular functions.
>   Another example is the Langlands program which connects Galois groups
>   in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory
>   of algebraic groups. The Erlangen program can also be seen as a way of
>   unifying different types of geometries using group theory. In all these
>   examples of unifications, there is a function (or an isomorphism) from
>   the domain of discourse of one field to the domain of discourse of another
>   field. The symmetries of one field (the true mathematical statements) will
>   than map to symmetries of the other field. Category theory is an entire
>   branch of mathematics that was created to describe such unifications. The
>   founders of category theory invented a language that was based on algebraic
>   topology, which is a branch of mathematics that unifies algebra and
>   topology. Category theory is now used in many areas to show that seemingly
>   different parts of mathematics (and physics and theoretical computer science)
>   are closely related. [^Aguirre2016p153]

Platonism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pythagoreanism

-   Radical realism
-   Monism: everything is math.

### Plato

-   Realist
-   Theory of the forms
-   Dualism: the world and forms?
-   The Academy (387 BCE - 529 CE): "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter"
-   Mathematics is descriptive of a real but trans-empirical realm.
-   Plato perhaps doubts Platonism in *Parmenides*
-   Aristotle on universals
