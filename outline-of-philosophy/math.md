Philosophy of mathematics
================================================================================

These next several outlines deal with philosophy of certain
specialized topics, starting with this one on the philosophy of mathematics.
Here we dig into issues of what is _**abstraction**_.

First we survey the following branches of mathematics:
logic, algebra, analysis, model theory.
Then we discuss unification programs across branches,
followed by sections on positions in philosophy of mathematics,
in particular dealing with the realism/antirealism or platonism/nominalism
debate.

### Transfinite numbers

-   Ordinal (index) vs cardinal (size) numbers
-   [Transfinite numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number):
    -   $\omega$: the lowest transfinite ordinal number; the order type of the natural numbers.
    -   $\aleph_0$: the first transfinite cardinal number; the cardinality of the natural numbers.
-   Transfinite numbers were anticipated by [Robert Grosseteste](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grosseteste/) (ca. 1168-1253).
-   Developed by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) (1845-1918) in 1895
    -   [Cantor's first set theory article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_first_set_theory_article)
    -   Proved that the real numbers are uncountably infinite.
    -   The cardinalities of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are both $C$.
-   [Cantor's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem)
    -   Let $|A| \equiv \mathrm{card}(A)$ denote the cardinality (i.e size) of a set, $A$.
    -   A power set, $P(A)$, of a set, $A$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
    -   The cardinality of a power set is $|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}$
    -   The cardinality of the natural numbers: $\aleph_0 \equiv |\mathbb{N}|$
    -   The cardinality of the reals: $C \equiv |\mathbb{R}| = |P(\mathbb{N})| = 2^{|\mathbb{N}|} = 2^{\aleph_0} > \aleph_0$
-   [Continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) (CH)
    -   CH: There is no set $S$ such that $\aleph_0 < |S| < 2^{\aleph_0}$
    -   Under the CH, $C = \aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}$.
    -   [Axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice)
    -   Paul Cohen showed the CH is undecidable in ZFC (1963).

### Propositional logic

-   [Propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic)
    -   AKA propositional calculus and zeroth-order logic
-   Validity and soundness:
    -   An argument is *valid* iff for any assignment of the truth values in the argument
        where all of the premises are true, the conclusion is always true.
    -   An argument is *sound* iff it is valid and all of its premises are true.
-   [Sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus)

*Syntactic consequence:*

$$ A \vdash B $$

means that $B$ is logically derivable/provable from $A$.

*Semantic consequence:*

$$ A \models B $$

means that in all possible valuations in which $A$ is true, $B$ is also true.
One says that $A$ "entails" $B$, or $A$ "models" $B$.

Note that $\vdash$, $\models$, and $\equiv$ are all metalogical symbols,
not part of the rules of logic; they are shorthands.

$\vdash$  means "from which, it is derivable that".          
$\models$ means "entails that, *i.e.* in every case this is true, that is true (regardless of provability)".           
$\equiv$ means "is notationally identical to".         

Lecture notes on soundness and completeness:

-   [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2800/2016sp/lectures/lec39-sound-complete.html)
-   [Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/cs245old/03-propsem.pdf)

A formal system is *sound* if everything that is provable is in fact true,
i.e. if $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n \vdash B$, then $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n \models B$.

A formal system is *complete* if everything that is true has a proof,
i.e. if $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n \models B$, then $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n \vdash B$.

Propositional logic was proven to be sound ($\vdash$ implies $\models$)
and complete ($\models$ implies $\vdash$) by Emil Post in 1921. [^Post1921]

### First-order logic

-   [First-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic)
    -   AKA predicate logic
    -   Adds (non-logical) predicates and quantification over elements
    -   Domain of discourse
-   C.S Peirce was first to distinguish between propositional logic,
    first-order logic, and second-order logic in 1885. [^Ewald2018]
-   Consistency, completeness, expressivity
-   [G&ouml;del's completeness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem)
    -   Establishes a correspondence between semantic truth and syntactic
        provability in first-order logic.
-   No first-order theory has the strength to uniquely describe a
    structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the
    real line.
-   In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and
    multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this
    cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic.

### Second-order logic

-   [Second-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic)
-   SEP: [Second-order and higher-order logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-higher-order/)
-   Includes relation variables in addition to object variables and allows quantification over both.
    -   Extends first-order logic to allow predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted.
-   The power set can be written in terms of second-order logic.
    -   This second-order expressibility of the power-set operation permits the simulation of higher-order logic within second order. [^Enderton2009]
-   Higher-order logics, type theory
    -   Russell's theory of types
    -   Alonzo Church's lambda calculus
-   Michael Dummett
-   Setwart Shapiro

-   Eliezer Yudkowsky
    -   [Second-Order Logic: The Controversy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SWn4rqdycu83ikfBa/second-order-logic-the-controversy)
    -   "Second-order logic is sound, in the sense that anything syntactically
        provable from a set of premises, is true in any model obeying those
        premises. But second-order logic isn't complete; there are semantic
        consequences you can't derive. If you take second-order logic at face
        value, there's no effectively computable way of deriving all the
        consequences of what you say you 'believe'... which is a major reason
        some mathematicians are suspicious of second-order logic. What does it
        mean to believe something whose consequences you can't derive?"

### Modal logic

-   [C.I. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._I._Lewis) (1883-1964)
    -   Founded modern modal logic.
    -   Criticism of material implication. Introduced strict implication. [^Lewis1917]
    -   Strict implication is not truth-functional. It requires asking
        about the truth-values that propositions take in worlds other than
        the actual world.
-   [Saul Kripke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke) (b. 1940)
    -   Kripke, S.A. (1959). A completeness theorem in modal logic. [^Kripke1959]
    -   Revives Leibniz's idea that necessity is truth in all possible worlds.
-   [David Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)) (1941-2001)
    -   *On the Plurality of Worlds* (1986) [^Lewis1986]

$\Box$ means "necessarily". $\Diamond$ means "possibly".

If necessarily $P$, then necessarily necessarily $P$:

$$ \Box P \rightarrow \Box \Box P $$

De Morgan duality:

$$ \Diamond P = \lnot \Box \lnot P $$

$$ \Box P = \lnot \Diamond \lnot P $$

### Alternative logics

-   Intuitionistic Logic
    -   Law of excluded middle (LEM): *Tertium non datur*.

    -   Law of No Contradiction (LNC).            
        $\models \lnot ( A \land \lnot A )$

### Incompleteness

-   [Kurt G&ouml;del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) (1906-1978)
-   Goldstein [^Goldstein2005]

Fom the SEP:

>   The first incompleteness theorem states that in any consistent formal
>   system $F$ within which a certain amount of arithmetic can be carried out,
>   there are statements of the language of $F$ which can neither be proved
>   nor disproved in $F$. According to the second incompleteness theorem,
>   such a formal system cannot prove that the system itself is consistent
>   (assuming it is indeed consistent). [^Raatikainen2020]

From Wikipedia:

-   G&ouml;del showed for that any formal system $S$ powerful enough to represent arithmetic,
    there is a theorem $G$ which is true but the system is unable to prove.
    $G$ could be added as an additional axiom to the system in place of a proof.
    However this would create a new system $S'$ with its own unprovable true theorem $G'$,
    and so on.
-   The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems
    can be listed by an "effective procedure" (e.g., a computer program, but it could be any
    sort of algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the natural numbers.
-   The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that such a system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.
    Sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).
-   G&ouml;del's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a theory $T_1$ satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any theory $T_2$ that proves the consistency of $T_1$. This is because such a theory $T_1$ can prove that if $T_2$ proves the consistency of $T_1$, then $T_1$ is in fact consistent. For the claim that $T_1$ is consistent has form "for all numbers $n$, $n$ has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in $T_1$". If $T_1$ were in fact inconsistent, then $T_2$ would prove for some $n$ that $n$ is the code of a contradiction in $T_1$. But if $T_2$ also proved that $T_1$ is consistent (that is, that there is no such $n$), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in $T_1$ to show that if $T_2$ is consistent, then $T_1$ is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, $T_1$ does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of $T_2$ either.
-   The corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would actually provide no interesting information if a theory T proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of T in T would give us no clue as to whether T really is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of T would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a theory T in some theory T' that is in some sense less doubtful than T itself, for example weaker than T. For many naturally occurring theories T and T', such as T = Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and T' = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of T' is provable in T, and thus T' can't prove the consistency of T by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.
-   The second incompleteness theorem does not rule out consistency proofs altogether, only consistency proofs that could be formalized in the theory that is proved consistent. For example, Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic (PA) in a different theory that includes an axiom asserting that the ordinal called $\varepsilon_0$ is wellfounded; see Gentzen's consistency proof. Gentzen's theorem spurred the development of ordinal analysis in proof theory.

Unification programs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Yanofsky, N.S. (2016). Why mathematics works so well:

>   When you have two distinct fields of mathematics and they are shown to be
>   intimately related in a way that results of one field can be used to get
>   results of another field, you have a type of unification. An example of
>   such unification is monstrous moonshine. This subject describes the
>   shocking connection between the monster group and modular functions.
>   Another example is the Langlands program which connects Galois groups
>   in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory
>   of algebraic groups. The Erlangen program can also be seen as a way of
>   unifying different types of geometries using group theory. In all these
>   examples of unifications, there is a function (or an isomorphism) from
>   the domain of discourse of one field to the domain of discourse of another
>   field. The symmetries of one field (the true mathematical statements) will
>   than map to symmetries of the other field. Category theory is an entire
>   branch of mathematics that was created to describe such unifications. The
>   founders of category theory invented a language that was based on algebraic
>   topology, which is a branch of mathematics that unifies algebra and
>   topology. Category theory is now used in many areas to show that seemingly
>   different parts of mathematics (and physics and theoretical computer science)
>   are closely related. [^Aguirre2016p153]

### Unreasonable effectiveness

>   Philosophy is written in that great book which
>   ever lies before our eyes---I mean the
>   Universe---but we cannot understand it if we do
>   not learn the language and grasp the symbols in
>   which it is written. This book is written in the
>   mathematical language, and the symbols are
>   triangles, circles, and other geometrical ﬁgures
>   without whose help it is impossible to comprehend
>   a single word of it, without which one wanders in
>   vain through a dark labyrinth.

Putnam:
