The scientific method
================================================================================

This outline discusses the history of science, 
the definition of the scientific method,
its central role in founding a scientific epistemology,
the demarcation of science from pseudoscience,
and other *epistemological* topics concerning the methods
and philosophy of science. 
The metaphysical implications of science
are discussed in the [Outline on scientific realism](scientific-realism.html).

### History of science

In this first section, we briefly outline chronologically highlights in
the development of science, after which there are sections focusing on topics
in the epistemology of science,
starting with [rationalism vs empiricism](#rationalism-vs-empiricism).

    -   Estimated the circumference of the Earth to be 50 times the distance between Alexandria and Syene,
        which was pretty acurate as it is actually 47.9 times! [^Weinberg2015p76]
-   [Lucretius (99-55 BCE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius)

Weinberg:

>   Like modern scientists, these early Greeks were willing to look beneath
>   the surface appearance of the world, pursuing knowledge about a deeper
>   level of reality. The matter of the world does not appear at first glance
>   as if it is all made of water, or air, or earth, or fire, or all four
>   together, or even atoms. [^Weinberg2015p7]

>   Nevertheless, I think one should not overemphasize the modern aspects
>   of Archaic or Greek science. There is an important feature of modern
>   science that is almost completely missing in all the thinkers I have
>   mentioned, from Thales to Plato: none of them attempted to verify or
>   even (aside perhaps from Zeno) seriously to justify their speculations.
>   In reading their writings, one continually wants to ask, "How do you know?"
>   This is just as true of Democritus as of others. Nowhere in the fragments
>   of his books that survive do we see any effort to show that matter
>   really is composed of atoms. [^Weinberg2015p11]

>   This did not occur to the early Greeks, or to many of their successors,
>   for a very simple reason: *they had never seen it done*. [^Weinberg2015p13]

### Analytic/synthetic distinction

-   Locke
    -   *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1689)
-   Kant

Kant in his *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781):

>   In all judgments in which we think the relation of a subject to the predicate...
>   this relation is possible in two ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the
>   subject A as something that is (covertly) contained in this concept A;
>   or B, though connected with concept A, lies quite outside it.
>   In the first case I call the judgment _analytic_; in the second, _synthetic_.
>   Hence (affirmative) analytic judgments are those in which the predicate's
>   connection with the subject is thought by [thinking] identity, whereas those
>   judgments in which this connection is thought without [thinking] identity are
>   to be called synthetic. Analytic judgments could also be called _elucidatory_.
>   For they do not through the predicate add anything to the concept of the subject;
>   rather, they only dissect the concept, breaking it up into its component concepts
>   which had already been thought in it (although thought confusedly).
>   Synthetic judgments, on the other hand, could also be called _expansive_.
>   For they do add to the concept of the subject a predicate that had not been
>   thought in that concept at all and could not have been extracted from it
>   by any dissection. [^Kant1996pB10]

de Swart:

>   Sometimes one speaks of logically necessary truths instead of analytic truths
>   and of logically contingent truths instead of synthetic truths,
>   to be distinguished from physically necessary truths (truths which physically
>   could not be otherwise, true in all physically possible worlds). The
>   distinction between necessary and contingent truth is a metaphysical one,
>   to be distinguished from the epistemological distinction
>   between a priori and a posteriori truths. Although
>   these---the metaphysical and the epistemological---are certainly different
>   distinctions, it was controversial whether they coincide in extension,
>   that is, whether all and only necessary truths are a priori and all and only
>   contingent truths are a posteriori. [^deSwart2018p141]

### Induction

#### Problem of induction

-   How do we infer universals from particulars?

Sextus Empiricus:

>   When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, 
>   they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. 
>   But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the 
>   particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; 
>   while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, 
>   since the particulars are infinite and indefinite. [^SextusEmpiricus]

#### Inductive logic

Newton:

>   In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induction
>   should be considered exactly or very nearly true not withstanding any contrary
>   hypothesis, until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more exact
>   or liable to exceptions. [^NewtonpX]

-   Mill
    -   *A System of Logic* (1843) [^Mill1843]
-   Peirce

Vickers:

>   [I]n Peirce's phrase, inductions are _ampliative_. Induction can amplify and
>   generalize our experience, broaden and deepen our empirical knowledge.
>   Deduction on the other hand is explicative. Deduction orders and
>   rearranges our knowledge without adding to its content. [^Vickers2014]

Peirce on _merely_ the denial of any major failures of induction
and the wonderful self-correcting nature of ampliative inference:

Peirce:

>   I maintain that it has been shown that the modes of inference in question are
>   necessarily valid, whatever the constitution of the universe, so long as it
>   admits of the premises being true.
>   Yet I am willing to concede, in order to concede as much as possible,
>   that when a man draws instances at random, all that he knows is that he
>   _tries_ to follow a certain precept; so that the sampling process might be
>   rendered generally fallacious by the existence of a mysterious and malign
>   connection between the mind and the universe, such that the possession by an
>   object of an _unperceived_ character might influence the will toward choosing
>   it or rejecting it. Such a circumstance would, however, be as fatal to
>   deductive as to ampliative inference. Suppose, for example, that I were
>   to enter a great hall where people were playing _rouge et noir_ at many tables;
>   and suppose that I knew that the red and black were turned up with equal
>   frequency. Then, if I were to make a large number of mental bets with myself,
>   at this table and at that, I might, by statistical deduction, expect to win
>   about half of them, ---precisely as I might expect, from the results of these
>   samples, to infer by induction the probable ratio of frequency of the
>   turnings of red and black in the long run, if I did not know it.
>   But could some devil look at each card before it was turned, and then
>   influence me mentally to bet upon it or to refrain therefrom, the observed
>   ratio in the cases upon which I had bet might be quite different from the
>   observed ratio in those cases upon which I had not bet. I grant, then,
>   that even upon my theory some fact has to be supposed to make induction
>   and hypothesis valid processes; namely, it is supposed that the supernal powers
>   withhold their hands and let me alone, and that no mysterious uniformity or

Wikipedia:

>    R. Bhaskar also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate, located in the enduring nature of something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless. [^Bhaskar2008pX]

>   Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters

### Models in science

French:

>   [S]cientist *don't* simply deduce experimental/observational consequences;
>   they construct models that 'mediate' between theories and the observations.
>   There are a number of reasons why scientists will proceed in this way
>   but one is that theories are often quite complex and difficult to work with.
>   So a scientist may build a simplified model, containing significant
>   idealizations that allow the scientist to ignore certain factors,
>   for example, and [more] easily relate the theory to observations. [^French2007p81]

Model the theory:

$$ T(\theta_k, \psi_m) \longrightarrow M(X_i | \theta_k, \nu_\ell) $$

Fit the model to the data to make inferences on the theory:

$$
    \{X_i\}_j
    \longrightarrow M(X_{ij} | \theta_k, \nu_\ell)
    \longrightarrow \hat{\theta}_k \pm \sigma_{\hat{\theta}_k} , \hat{\nu}_\ell \pm \sigma_{\hat{\nu}_\ell}
    \longrightarrow T(\hat{\theta}_k \pm \sigma_{\hat{\theta}_k}, \psi_m)
$$

Frigg:

>   Morgan and Morrison (1999) rally around the idea that models are instruments
>   that mediate between theories and the world. Models are "autonomous agents"
>   in that they are independent from both theories and their target systems,
>   and it is this independence that allows them to mediate between the two.
>   Theories do not provide us with algorithms for the construction of a model;
>   they are not "vending machines" into which one can insert a problem and a
>   model pops out (Cartwright 1999). The construction of a model often requires
>   detailed knowledge about materials, approximation schemes, and the setup,
>   and these are not provided by the corresponding theory. Furthermore,
>   the inner workings of a model are often driven by a number of different
>   theories working cooperatively. In contemporary climate modeling,
>   for instance, elements of different theories---among them fluid dynamics,
>   thermodynamics, electromagnetism---are put to work cooperatively.
>   What delivers the results is not the stringent application of one theory,
>   but the voices of different theories when put to use in chorus with each
>   other in one model. [^Frigg2020]

### Is there a universal scientific method?

#### First pass

Feynman:

>   [S]cience is a method of finding things out. This method is based on
>   the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is
>   so or not. All other aspects and characteristics of science can be
>   understood directly when we understand that observation is the ultimate
>   and final judge of the truth of an idea...
>   That is the principle of science. If there is an exception to any rule,
>   and it can be proved by observation, that rule is wrong. [^Feynman1998p15]

Feynman:

>   There are in science a number of technical consequences that follow from
>   the principle of observation as judge. For example, the observation
>   cannot be rough. You have to be very careful. There may have been a
>   piece of dirt in the apparatus that made the color change; it was not
>   what you thought. You have to check the observations very carefully,
>   and then recheck them, to be sure that you understand what all the
>   conditions are and that you did not misinterpret what you did. [^Feynman1998p17]

### Scientific knowledge and realism

-   Knowledge = JTB-G. Plato.
-   Systematic uncertainties.  Failed justification.
-   Gettier cases.
-   Feynman

Feynman:

>   All scientific knowledge is uncertain...
>   [W]hat we call scientific knowledge today is a body of statements of
>   varying degrees of certainty. Some of them are most unsure. Some of
>   them nearly sure; but none of them is certain. [^Feynman1998p26]

-   Hume on the problem of induction and the uniformity of nature.
-   Uniformitarianism: Unless we have a collective and/or non-local conspiracies,
    we can probablistically justify assumptions of uniformity.

>   five o'clock; on the basis of this you believe that it's five o'clock.
>   Your belief is justified, and as it happens it is five o'clock.
>   But unbeknownst to you, the clock stopped exactly twelve hours ago. [^Russell2009]
