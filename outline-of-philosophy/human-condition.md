### Early hunter gatherers

>   The early human migrations
>   in the Lower Paleolithic saw Homo erectus spread across Eurasia 1.8 million
>   years ago. The controlled use of fire first occurred 800,000 years ago in the
>   Middle Paleolithic. 250,000 years ago, Homo sapiens (modern humans) emerged
>   in Africa. 60--70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along
>   a coastal route to South and Southeast Asia and reached Australia.
>   50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from Asia to the Near East.
>   Europe was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago.
>   Humans migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago in the Upper
>   Paleolithic. [^WikiAncientHistory]

>   Unlike our species, Neanderthals probably did not need to be good
>   long-distance runners. Homo sapiens lived on hot, dry African grasslands,
>   where they hunted by pursuing large animals over long distances until they
>   collapsed from heat exhaustion. In the cooler regions occupied by
>   Neanderthals, heat exhaustion would not be a problem, so running long
>   distances would not have helped them hunt. Instead, they took advantage
>   of their landscape and ambushed prey. [^Marshall2011]

    ignorance/delusion ([avijja](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Avidya)), 
    attachment ([lobha](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Raga)), and

decidedly not naturalistic:

>   field of metaphysics, is to study the works of those who were, and who,

    -   focus on emotion

William Jones, in his 1772 "Essay on the Arts called Imitative", was one of the
first to propound an expressive theory of poetry, valorising expression over
description or imitation:

>   If the arguments, used in this essay, have any weight, it will appear,
>   that the finest parts of poetry, musick, and painting, are expressive of
>   the passions...the inferior parts of them are descriptive of natural
>   objects.
