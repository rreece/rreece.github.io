### Biology

#### Darwinism

-   We are animals.
-   We are from a lineage.
-   We are all related.
-   We are evolved.
-   We are complex.

#### Evolution of vision

-   We are adapted certain ways for certain environmental reasons.

>   Water is strongly absorbing at most of the wavelengths in the electromagnetic
>   spectrum, but it has a narrow window of transparency which includes the visible
>   spectrum. The span of the absorption spectrum shown is from wavelengths on the
>   order of a kilometer down to about the size of a proton, about 10--15 meters.
>   It doesn't absorb in the wavelength range of visible light,
>   roughly 400--700 nm, because there is no physical mechanism which produces
>   transitions in that region---it is too energetic for the vibrations of the
>   water molecule and below the energies needed to cause electronic transitions. [^Nave2016]

>   and in deed as far as I could that we will be better men, braver,
>   less idle, if we believe that one must search for the things one
>   does not know, rather than if we believe that it is not possible
