<p><em>Day 1, morning, 1st session</em></p>
<h2 id="participants-introduce-themselves">Participants introduce themselves</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Nicholas Pritzker</strong> - Investor worth $1.3 B, sponsored the event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sean Carroll</strong> - Conference organizer. Cosmologist at Cal Tech. Wishes he had written a book about atheism. Compatiblist, but curious about free will.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Richard Dawkins</strong> - Oxford biologist. If not naturalism then what? Super-human is surely possible, but what would supernatural even mean?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don Ross</strong> - Ph.D. philosophy of science. Works in both philosophy and economics. Interested in the unification of economics with other sciences. Economics as the study of information systems. Wrote <em>Every Thing Must Go - Metaphysics Naturalized</em> with James Ladyman - criticism of metaphysics with pre-scientific views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophers, for the most part, analytic philosophers particularly, have failed to really promote naturalism and give it its proper innings because of lingering commitments to pre-scientific worldviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David Lewis, for example, does not take contemporary physics seriously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Analytic metaphysics,] as practiced in the world's best philosophy departments right now, it's virtually all nonsense. It virtually all presupposes demonstrably false physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>QFT is inconsistent with the presuppositions of most analytic metaphysics. What if we take real physics seriously? What about the special sciences? Science should provide us with a general worldview. Runs an experimental economics lab at the U of Capetown. Would like to change his mind about the philosophy of mathematics since he changes it often.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alex Rosenberg</strong> - Started in physics. Works in the philosophy of biology. Views that naturalism is deeply incompatible with Sellars' <em>manifest image</em> (the obvious furniture of reality in contrast to the <em>scientific image</em>). Wrote <em>The Atheist Guide to Reality</em>. Others in the room call him a &quot;maddog reductionist&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owen Flanagan</strong> - Philosopher. Embraces Sellars' view that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is the study of how things, conceived of in the broadest possible sense, hang together in the broadest possible sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grew up Catholic. Studied with Quine and some of his students. The best philosophy is continuous with science. Interested in consciousness and ethics. Disturbed by the way philosophers moan about the &quot;hard problem&quot;. Wrote <em>Varieties of Moral Personality - Ethics and Psychological Realism</em>. Believes that ethics can be naturalized. Morality is just a social institution. You can't derive is from ought, but you can make inferences to the best explanation about what you ought to do, and there are often competing goods. Tries to combat the issue that most Americans have trouble finding meaning in a naturalistic worldview. Also studies classical Chinese and Indian philosophy. Free will is black hole in philosophy that other cultures avoid discussing. Also interested in <em>positive illusions</em> - are false beliefs always bad?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simon DeDeo</strong> - Started in cosmology at U Chicago. Studies complexity theory at the Sante Fe Inst. Self-described platonist, functionalist. Studies social systems with group theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Terrence Deacon</strong> - Began college in physics. Got interested cybernetics. Co-authored a 900 page book on the Apple-II computer. Charles Pierce's work made him drop-out of physics and write a philosophy thesis on Pierce. Interested in neuroscience and biological anthropology. Tracer techniques in neuroscience. Worked in cross-species neuron transplantation. Anti-theist but engages the Templeton Foundation. Interested in rethinking the concept of information. How do we get reference and normativity? How does a molecule become about something? Does not think that brains are like computers. Is still a functionalist, but thinks our theories of computation are not adequate to explain brains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rebecca Goldstein</strong> - Grew up in an orthodox Jewish home. As a child, read <em>Our Friend the Atom</em> and Bertrand Russle's <em>Why I am not a Christian</em>. Wanted to be a physicist. Sydney Morganbesser convinced her to study philosophy of science. Went to Princeton to study philosophy. Wanted to study foundations of quantum mechanics. Then read Thomas Nagel's &quot;What it is like to be a bat&quot;. She is a materialist but fascinated by the mind-body problem. Was driven to write philosophical novels out of frustration of philosophy's dependence on character, intuitions, and presuppositions. Thinks she ruined her philosophy career with her first novel <em>Mind-body Problem</em>. Fascinated by philosophy of mathematics. Thinks Godel's work leads to mathematical realism. Would like to believe that philosophy can make progress past people's intuitions, but isn't yet convinced.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daniel Dennett</strong> - Quine was his hero and mentor. Didn't study any science originally, but realized he needed to know something about the brain. Studied with Gilbert Ryle. Got informal education from many scientists. Doesn't spend much time with many philosophers these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is a wonderfully chosen group. When I think of all the people in the field of philosophy that aren't here, I am so glad they are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Owen he is appalled that despite the progress naturalism has made in the last few decades, there is a retrograde gang of philosophers that do armchair philosophy that is not worth a damn. Willfred Sellars nailed it: philosophy should be about helping our intuitions understand how the manifest image goes with the scientific image, to bring consilience. Compatiblist. Things the brain should be thought of as having humuncular functionalism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brain is a largely anarchic assemblage of selfish neurons that have agendas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning the manifest/scientific image, in one sense there is no color, but if you call the front desk and say there is no color TV in your hotel room, they will know what you mean.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Day 1, morning, 2nd session</em></p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Massimo Pigliucci</strong> - Started as an evolutionary biologist, studying gene-environment interactions, nature/nurture. Midlife crisis made up move to NYC and get a second Ph.D. in philosophy. Now a professor at CUNY. Science and philosophy do different things, but are both part of <em>scientia</em>. Interested in the demarcation problem. Thinks that philosophy does make progress. Has a tattoo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth springs from argument amongst friends. -- Hume</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likes Ladyman and Ross' book which changed his mind about many things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David Poeppel</strong> - Undergrad in cell biology and linguistics. Then worked as an actor before going to grad school. Runs a human brain science lab at NYU, studying the temporal structural of perceptual experience. The parts list of the brain. Thinks neuroscience has generally failed so far. So far neuroscience has been successful at the &quot;maps problem&quot; making finer resolution maps of the brain, but not yet many conceptual advances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jennifer Oullet</strong> - Science writer. Recoiled from an evangelical religious family. Carroll's wife.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jerry Coyne</strong> - Evolutionary biologist at U Chicago. Incompatiblist: consciousness and free will are an illusion, not meaning that they aren't real, but they are not what they seem to be. Realized that to teach evolution it was necessary to argue against religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are collations of molecules that obey the laws of physics, and sometimes it appears that we do that rationally, but a lot of times we don't. My replacement for free will would be the statement: Our decisions are made by internal forces that we don't understand, and that we should deep-six the idea of free will in terms of this statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are there other ways to know besides science (art, music, literature)? For example, if your kid tells you they are hungry, that's a way of knowing that is not science.</p>
<p>(<strong>Ryan, the author of these notes</strong>): I disagree, it's still science: empirical and falsifiable. You could ask them to repeat it in case you mis-heard them; you could look closely to verify you aren't mis-identifying them, empirically improving your confidence in the information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steven Weinberg</strong> - Works in particle physics, QFT, and cosmology. One of the founders of the Standard Model. Serious BAMF. Reality and naturalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm all for them, but I'm not sure what they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consciousness and mathematics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I know what they are, but I don't see how they fit into natural science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confesses he has strong views on emergence, morality, and free will that are unlikely to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Janna Levin</strong> - (Showed up late and introduced herself later in the day 1, afternoon, 1st session.) TODO.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-is-reality">What is reality?</h2>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's nothing but fermions and bosons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Physics has not yet bottomed out, but we don't have to know the fundamental ontology (string theory or otherwise). Perhaps it won't ever bottom out. Naturalism doesn't require us to take sides on matters at the frontiers of physics. Naturalism can trust three features of physics to not change (despite possible future revolutions):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Resolute denial of teleology</em>: no backward causation from the future pulling events in some trajectory, or any eminent causation that involves some kind of representation of what the future must be like. The denial of purpose and goals in physics.</li>
<li><em>Second law of thermodynamics</em>: generates the time-asymmetries in physics. Further, all the asymmetries in physics are a result of the time-asymmetries. (<strong>Ryan</strong>: really? maybe.)</li>
<li><em>Reductionism</em>: denial of downward causation. Physics is causally closed. The explanatory power of the special sciences are an epistemic thesis and not a metaphysical one, and represent cognitive limitations of humans, and no fundamental facts about the organization of reality.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(Ryan)</strong></p>
<p>I think Alex goes too far with his last points about reductionism. Emergent facts about reality are still facts, interesting, and metaphysically real, albeit not in the same way as (more) fundamental physics. I agree that we should emphasize that reductionism means that there is no downward causation.</p>
<p><strong>Sean</strong></p>
<p>If we buy that particle physics has no teleology in it, is it nevertheless useful to talk about emergent phenomena as having teleological explanation? The neck of the giraffe has a purpose, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we can help ourselves to that vocabulary, but we should acknowledge that we are engaging in a somewhat misleading set of metaphors, similar to the issue of &quot;design&quot; in evolutionary biology.</p>
<p><strong>Don</strong></p>
<p>You (Alex) are committed to the view that &quot;physics fixes all the facts&quot;. Fundamental physics does not address all the facts, and the most interesting facts are the ones that are the most general. What you mean is that if we had a computer that could in principle calculate all the fundamental physics (Laplace's demon) then we could derive all the facts of the special sciences. It's very hard for me to see what could constitute evidence for that claim. That looks like a statement of metaphysical faith.</p>
<p><strong>(Ryan)</strong></p>
<p>I agree Don has clarified the issue of what reductionism entails, but he shouldn't be skeptical about it, as we verify that physics is causally closed every time we look for new experimental effects beyond it.</p>
<p><strong>Steven</strong></p>
<p>Why should we have this kind of philistinism? Is the manifest image something that makes sense and is permissible to us? Sure. Barack Obama is real and Santa Claus is not, and not for reasons that require particle physics. Temperature is real; protons are real; the constitution is real; this newspaper is real; but real in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong></p>
<p>I agree with you (Steven). We should remember that there is another camp of philosophy that would say that the manifest image is what is real and causal, and the posits of physics are instrumentalist fantasies. Now, we as naturalist are committed to the ontology of the physical sciences, but we shouldn't go to the other extreme and deny the reality of the manifest image. We can count the glasses on the table.</p>
<p>(Ryan): TODO highlight Dan's point.</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<p>(Back-pedaling) That's not a thesis I was defending. There's nothing but fermions and bosons... and everything that is made up of fermions and bosons. There are also chemical facts, biological facts, economic facts. But if you fix the relations of the fermions and bosons, you get all the same emergent phenomena as well.</p>
<p><strong>Sean</strong></p>
<p>What about the Schrodinger equation?</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<p>I agree, the ontology of mathematical relations is perplexing.</p>
<p>Some, like Dan, will say that teleology is a garden variety causal process that involves blind variation and natural selection operating on many levels and using many different mechanisms to produce adaptation. Not only that, we should also recognize that Darwin naturalized teleology and purpose, giving the real causal mechanism underlying it. On the other hand, I think Darwin showed that there is <em>not</em> any teleology in nature, period.</p>
<p><strong>Steven</strong></p>
<p>I have to agree with you (Alex) because so much of the progress in the history of science has been in removing teleology from explanation, in Aristotle's physics and in the biology before Darwin.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong></p>
<p>We have a political obligation to not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>TODO...</p>
<p>(Ryan): Designs and designoids are both solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>
<p>TODO...</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong></p>
<p>TODO...</p>
<p>&quot;Turns out you can divide an atom.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is an easier pedagogical task to convince people that there's design without a designer, design without an intelligent designer, than it is to convince them that there isn't any design.</p>
