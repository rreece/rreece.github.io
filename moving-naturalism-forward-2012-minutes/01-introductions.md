*[Day 1, morning, 1st session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju4C_ITlBsU&list=PLrxfgDEc2NxYQuZ5T6CSdS8uafdh0kmDL&index=0)*

1.  **Nicholas Pritzker** - Investor worth $1.3 B, sponsored the event.

2.  **Sean Carroll** - Conference organizer.  Cosmologist at Cal Tech.  Wishes he
    had written a book about atheism.
    Compatiblist, but curious about free will.

3.  **Richard Dawkins** - Oxford biologist.  If not naturalism then what?  Super-human
    is surely possible, but what would supernatural even mean?

4.  **Don Ross** - Ph.D. philosophy of science.  Works in both philosophy and economics.
    Interested in the unification of economics with other sciences.
    Economics as the study of information systems.
    Wrote *Every Thing Must Go - Metaphysics Naturalized* with James Ladyman - criticism
    of metaphysics with pre-scientific views.

    > Philosophers, for the most part, analytic philosophers particularly, have failed to
    > really promote naturalism and give it its proper innings because of lingering commitments
    > to pre-scientific worldviews.

    David Lewis, for example, does not take contemporary physics seriously.

    > [Analytic metaphysics,] as practiced in the world's best philosophy departments right now,
    > it's virtually all nonsense.  It virtually all presupposes demonstrably false physics.
    
    QFT is inconsistent with the presuppositions of most analytic metaphysics.
    What if we take real physics seriously?
    What about the special sciences?
    Science should provide us with a general worldview.
    Runs an experimental economics lab at the U of Capetown.
    Would like to change his mind about the philosophy of mathematics
    since he changes it often.

5.  **Alex Rosenberg** - Started in physics.  Works in the philosophy of biology.
    Views that naturalism is deeply incompatible with Sellars' *manifest image*
    (the obvious furniture of reality in contrast to the *scientific image*).
    Wrote *The Atheist Guide to Reality*.
    Others in the room call him a "maddog reductionist".

6.  **Owen Flanagan** - Philosopher.  Embraces Sellars' view that 

    > Philosophy is the study of how things, conceived of in the broadest possible sense,
    > hang together in the broadest possible sense.

    Grew up Catholic.  Studied with Quine and some of his students.
    The best philosophy is continuous with science.  Interested in consciousness and
    ethics.  Disturbed by the way philosophers moan about the "hard problem".
    Wrote *Varieties of Moral Personality - Ethics and Psychological Realism*.
    Believes that ethics can be naturalized.
    Morality is just a social institution.
    You can't derive is from ought, but you can make inferences to the best explanation
    about what you ought to do, and there are often competing goods.
    Tries to combat the issue that most Americans have trouble finding meaning in
    a naturalistic worldview.
    Also studies classical Chinese and Indian philosophy.
    Free will is black hole in philosophy that other cultures avoid discussing.
    Also interested in *positive illusions* - are false beliefs always bad?

7.  **Simon DeDeo** - Started in cosmology at U Chicago.  Studies complexity theory at the Sante Fe Inst.
    Self-described platonist, functionalist.  Studies social systems with group theory.

8.  **Terrence Deacon** - Began college in physics.  Got interested cybernetics.
    Co-authored a 900 page book on the Apple-II computer.
    Charles Pierce's work made him drop-out of physics and write a philosophy thesis on Pierce.
    Interested in neuroscience and biological anthropology.
    Tracer techniques in neuroscience.
    Worked in cross-species neuron transplantation.
    Anti-theist but engages the Templeton Foundation.
    Interested in rethinking the concept of information.
    How do we get reference and normativity?
    How does a molecule become about something?
    Does not think that brains are like computers.
    Is still a functionalist, but thinks our theories of computation are not
    adequate to explain brains.

9.  **Rebecca Goldstein** - Grew up in an orthodox Jewish home.
    As a child, read *Our Friend the Atom* and Bertrand Russell's *Why I am not a Christian*.
    Wanted to be a physicist.  Sydney Morganbesser convinced her to study philosophy of science.
    Went to Princeton to study philosophy.  Wanted to study foundations of quantum mechanics.
    Then read Thomas Nagel's "What it is like to be a bat".
    She is a materialist but fascinated by the mind-body problem.
    Was driven to write philosophical novels out of frustration of philosophy's dependence
    on character, intuitions, and presuppositions.
    Thinks she ruined her philosophy career with her first novel *Mind-body Problem*.
    Fascinated by philosophy of mathematics.
    Thinks Godel's work leads to mathematical realism.
    Would like to believe that philosophy can make progress past people's intuitions,
    but isn't yet convinced.

10. **Daniel Dennett** - Philosopher at Tuft's. Quine was his hero and mentor.
    Didn't study any science originally, but realized he needed to know something about the
    brain.  Studied with Gilbert Ryle. Got informal education from many scientists.
    Doesn't spend much time with many philosophers these days.

    > I think this is a wonderfully chosen group. When I think of all the people in the field of
    > philosophy that aren't here, I am so glad they are not.

    Like Owen he is appalled that despite the progress naturalism has made in the last few decades,
    there is a retrograde gang of philosophers that do armchair philosophy that is not worth a damn.
    Willfred Sellars nailed it: philosophy should be about helping our intuitions understand how
    the manifest image goes with the scientific image, to bring consilience.
    Compatiblist.  Thinks the brain should be thought of as having humuncular functionalism.

    > The brain is a largely anarchic assemblage of selfish neurons that have agendas.

    Concerning the manifest/scientific image, in one sense there is no color,
    but if you call the front desk and say there is no color TV in your hotel room,
    they will know what you mean.

11. **Massimo Pigliucci** - Started as an evolutionary biologist,
    studying gene-environment interactions,
    nature/nurture.  Midlife crisis lead him to move to NYC and get a second Ph.D. in philosophy.
    Became a philosophy professor at CUNY.
    Science and philosophy do different things, but are both part of *scientia*.
    Interested in the demarcation problem.
    Thinks that philosophy does make progress.
    Has a tattoo:
    
    > Truth springs from argument amongst friends. -- Hume (Misattributed)

    Likes Ladyman and Ross' book which changed his mind about many things.

12. **David Poeppel** - Undergrad in cell biology and linguistics.  Then worked
    as an actor before going to grad school.
    Runs a human brain science lab at NYU, studying the temporal structural
    of perceptual experience.  The parts list of the brain.
    Thinks neuroscience has generally failed so far.
    So far neuroscience has been successful at the "maps problem"
    making finer resolution maps of the brain, but not yet many conceptual advances.

13. **Jennifer Oullet** - Science writer.  Recoiled from an evangelical religious family.
    Married to Sean Carroll.

14. **Jerry Coyne** - Evolutionary biologist at U Chicago.
    Incompatiblist: consciousness and free will are an illusion, not meaning that they
    aren't real, but they are not what they seem to be.
    Realized that to teach evolution it was necessary to argue against religion.

    > We are collations of molecules that obey the laws of physics,
    > and sometimes it appears that we do that rationally, but a lot of times we don't.
    > My replacement for free will would be the statement: Our decisions are made by
    > internal forces that we don't understand, and that we should deep-six the idea of
    > free will in terms of this statement.

    Are there other ways to know besides science (art, music, literature)?
    For example, if your kid tells you they are hungry,
    that's a way of knowing that is not science.

    **(Ryan, the author of these notes)**: I disagree, it's still scientific: empirical and falsifiable.
    You could ask your kid to repeat in case you mis-heard them;
    you could look closely to verify you aren't mis-identifying them;
    you can verify (insofar as you get accurate feedback from the kid) that their hunger subsides after feeding them;
    empirically improving your confidence in the information.

15. **Steven Weinberg** - Works in particle physics, QFT, and cosmology.
    One of the founders of the Standard Model.  Serious BAMF.
    Reality and naturalism:
    
    > I'm all for them, but I'm not sure what they are.

    Consciousness and mathematics:
    
    > I think I know what they are, but I don't see how they fit into natural science.

    Confesses he has strong views on emergence, morality, and free will that are
    unlikely to change.

16. **Janna Levin** - (Introduced herself later in the day 1, afternoon, 1st session.)
    TODO.
