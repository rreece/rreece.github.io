Hi!  I'm Ryan.
I am a former postdoctoral researcher at the [Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/),
who worked with the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/) at [CERN](http://home.cern/).

I have experience in data science, pattern recognition, statistical modeling,
statistical inference, petabyte data reduction, and machine learning.

Previously as a graduate student at Penn,
also with ATLAS, I helped commission the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT),
a sub-detector of the ATLAS tracker,
during the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2009-2012.
On July 4 of 2012, [the ATLAS and CMS experiments both announced discovering a new particle consistent with the long-sought-after Higgs boson](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html),
a key to explaining electroweak symmetry breaking in the
[Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)
of particle physics.

I've spent 10 years romping through datasets from ATLAS,
learning how to explore and model large, multidimentional datasets.
I have a knack for [developing data analysis frameworks](http://rreece.github.io/sw/)
and an eye for technical detail and [good scholarship](http://rreece.github.io/publications/).
I am passionate about using scientific techniques to solve important problems
and about how technologies extend our reach.


Research Interests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model have revolutionary
implications for the concepts of symmetry and space-time, and
for our understanding of the early universe.
Searching for new physics in collider data involves detecting rare events among many,
requiring big data reductions, data-driven background modeling,
and severe statistical hypothesis testing.
My research has primarily focused on supporting and optimizing the reconstruction
of hadronic tau decays, and searching for exotic new physics in ditau and diphoton events,
including for signs of grand unified theories and supersymmetry.
More recently, for the last year,
my research has transitioned to using deep learning techniques for particle physics
reconstruction and other classification problems.

### Thesis

My graduate research in particle physics was on the reconstruction and identification of
hadronic tau decays with the ATLAS experiment,
measuring the *Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;* production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at *&radic;s* = 7 TeV,
and searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events.
