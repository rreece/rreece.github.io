Hi!  I'm Ryan.
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/),
working with the ATLAS experiment at CERN.

I have experience in data science, pattern recognition, statistical modeling, statistical inference, petabyte data reduction, and machine learning.

Previously as a graduate student at Penn,
also with ATLAS, I helped commission the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT),
a sub-detector of the ATLAS tracker, during the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
in 2009-2012. In July of 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments both announced discovering
a new particle consistent with the long-sought-after Higgs boson,
a key to explaining electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model of particle physics.

My research has primarily focused on supporting and optimizing the reconstruction
of hadronic tau decays, and searching for exotic new physics in ditau and diphoton events,
including for signs of Grand Unified Theories and Supersymmetry.
Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model have revolutionary
implications for the concepts of symmetry and space-time, and
for our understanding of the early universe.

Current projects I am focussed on:

-   Searching for evidence of supersymmetry in diphoton events
-   Research in applications of machine learning for particle identification with ILC-CLIC simulation data

Previous focusses:

-   Tau lepton identification and physics
-   Observation and cross section measurement of SM *Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;* 
-   Searching for exotic Higgs and *Z'&rarr;&tau;&tau;* events
-   Member of the ATLAS Physics Office helping manage paper submissions to journals,
    review talks/posters, and keeping publication statistics for the collaboration

### Thesis

My graduate research in particle physics was on the reconstruction and identification of
hadronic tau decays with the ATLAS experiment,
measuring the SM *Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;* production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at *&radic;s* = 7 TeV,
and searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events.
