Hi!  I'm Ryan.
I am a former postdoctoral researcher at the [Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/),
who worked with the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/) at [CERN](http://home.cern/)
and as a machine learning engineer at
[Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/).

I have experience in deep learning, large-scale language modeling,
natural language processing, computer vision,
classical machine learning, statistical modeling,
data science, and petabyte data reduction.

I am passionate about using scientific techniques to solve important
problems and about how technologies extend our reach.
