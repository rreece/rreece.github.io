### Research history

Previously as a graduate student at Penn,
working with [ATLAS Experiment](https://atlas.cern/)
at [CERN](https://home.cern/),
I helped commission the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT),
a sub-detector of the ATLAS tracker,
during the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2009-2012.
On July 4 of 2012, the 
[ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7214) and 
[CMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7235) experiments both 
[announced discovering a new particle consistent with the long-sought-after Higgs boson](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html),
a key to explaining electroweak symmetry breaking in the
[Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)
of particle physics.

I continued to work in the ATLAS Experiment as a postdoc at the
[Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/).
I've spent 10 years romping through datasets from ATLAS,
learning how to explore and model large, multidimentional datasets.
I have a knack for [developing data analysis frameworks](http://rreece.github.io/sw/)
and an eye for technical detail and [good scholarship](http://rreece.github.io/publications/).
I am passionate about using scientific techniques to solve important problems
and about how technologies extend our reach.

Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model have revolutionary
implications for the concepts of symmetry and space-time, and
for our understanding of the early universe.
Searching for new physics in collider data involves detecting rare events among many,
requiring big data reductions, data-driven background modeling,
and severe statistical hypothesis testing.

![A figure I drew with [Kyle Cranmer](http://theoryandpractice.org/) of the big-picture of the flow of ATLAS data.](img/atlas-data-flow.png "Experiment &rarr; data acquisition &rarr; reconstruction &rarr; analysis &rarr; inference")

My research in physics has primarily focused on supporting and optimizing
the reconstruction of hadronic tau decays,
and searching for exotic new physicsin ditau and diphoton events,
including for signs of grand unified theories and supersymmetry.
In my time with the ATLAS Collaboration I made substantial
contributions to [14 publications in scientific journals](../publications/index.html#atlas-publications) and several more physics conference proceedings.

Since 2016, following the deep learning revolution,
I've been trying to learn everything I can about deep learning.
I've worked in computer vision,
machine translation, and
large-scale language modeling.

In April of 2018, I joined [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net)
as a machine learning engineer.
Cerebras makes cutting-edge accelerators for deep learning,
the first to achieve
[Wafer-Scale Intergration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer-scale_integration).
Collaborators at Cerebras and I published a new normalization
technique, OnlineNorm, for training deep neural networks with small batch sizes
([*NeurIPS 2019*](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/cb3ce9b06932da6faaa7fc70d5b5d2f4-Abstract.html),
[arxiv:1905.05894](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05894)).
I developed and supported several reference models for Cerebras in
computer vision (ResNets) and NLP (GNMT, Transformer, Linformer, BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2).
[Cerebras revealed](https://www.cerebras.net/a-successful-week-for-cerebras-at-supercomputing-2019/)
its first product at Supercomputering 2019: the poweful CS-1 computer for AI.
[I helped](img/ryan-reece-cerebras-SC19.jpg) represent Cerebras at its tradeshow booth.
In April of 2022, I co-authored a blog about
[Getting started with PyTorch BERT models on the Cerebras CS-2 System](https://cerebras.net/blog/getting-started-with-pytorch-bert-models-on-the-cerebras-cs-2-system/).

at *&radic;s* = 7 TeV,
and searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events.
