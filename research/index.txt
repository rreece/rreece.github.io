Previously as a graduate student at Penn,
working with [ATLAS Experiment](https://atlas.cern/)
at [CERN](https://home.cern/),
I helped commission the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT),
a sub-detector of the ATLAS tracker,
during the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2009-2012.
On July 4 of 2012, the 
[ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7214) and 
[CMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7235) experiments both 
[announced discovering a new particle consistent with the long-sought-after Higgs boson](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html),
a key to explaining electroweak symmetry breaking in the
[Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)
of particle physics.

I continued to work in the ATLAS Experiment as a postdoc at the
[Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/),
I've spent 10 years romping through datasets from ATLAS,
learning how to explore and model large, multidimentional datasets.
I have a knack for [developing data analysis frameworks](http://rreece.github.io/sw/)
and an eye for technical detail and [good scholarship](http://rreece.github.io/publications/).
I am passionate about using scientific techniques to solve important problems
and about how technologies extend our reach.

Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model have revolutionary
implications for the concepts of symmetry and space-time, and
for our understanding of the early universe.

Searching for new physics in collider data involves detecting rare events among many,
requiring big data reductions, data-driven background modeling,
and severe statistical hypothesis testing.

In physics, my research has primarily focused on supporting and optimizing the reconstruction
of hadronic tau decays, and searching for exotic new physics in ditau and diphoton events,
including for signs of grand unified theories and supersymmetry.

Since about 2015, following the deep learning revolution,
I've been trying to learn everything I can about deep learning.
I've worked in computer vision, large-scale language modeling,
and machine translation.

### Ph.D. thesis

My graduate research in particle physics was on the reconstruction and identification of
hadronic tau decays with the ATLAS experiment,
measuring the *Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;* production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at *&radic;s* = 7 TeV,
and searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events.
