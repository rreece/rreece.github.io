ATLAS talks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's my selected list of public talks I have given on physics with the
ATLAS experiment.

1. *[ATLAS searches for heavy Higgs bosons and supersymmetry using tau decays](talks/)*        
    *on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration*        
    *2016/09/23*         
    A conference talk I gave at
    [Tau2016: International Workshop on Tau Lepton Physics](http://tau2016.ihep.ac.cn/) in Beijing, China,
    reviewing ATLAS searches for heavy Higgs bosons and supersymmetry with tau leptons in the final states.
    The analyses discussed use datasets corresponding to approximately 13-15/fb of 13 TeV proton-proton
    collision data taken in the years 2015-2016.

1. *[Searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events at ATLAS](talks/2013-08-15-RReece-ZprimeTauTau-DPF-UCSC.pdf)*         
    *on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration*         
    *2013/08/15*         
    A conference talk I gave at
    [APS Meeting: Divison of Particles and Fields (DPF) 2013](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/dpf2013/)
    reporting results from searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events
    in the ATLAS experiment with the 20/fb of proton-proton collision data collected in 2012.

1. *[A search for new physics in high-mass ditau events in the ATLAS detector](talks/2013-06-12-RReece-ditaus-at-ATLAS-thesis-defense.pdf)*         
    *2013/06/12*         
    My thesis defense.

1.  *[Searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events at ATLAS](talks/2012-12-13-RReece-ZprimeTauTau-Yale)*      
    *2012/12/13*, *12/11*, *11/26*, and *11/20*    
    A seminar I gave at Yale University summarizing my efforts in tau lepton physics at ATLAS,
    including the first ATLAS cut-based tau identification, the $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ cross section,
    and the first search for $Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ at ATLAS.
    I gave similar seminars at NYU, UT Austin, and (remotely to) Brookhaven National Lab.

1.  *[Hadronic tau decays in ATLAS](talks/2012-11-13-RReece-ATLAS-tau-performance-Chicago.pdf)*    
    *2012/11/13*      
    A review of the tau object reconstructed and supported by ATLAS and its current status,
    given at the [Chicago 2012 Workshop on LHC Physics](https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=206375),
    The University of Chicago.

1.  *[Searches for charged Higgs bosons, supersymmetry, and exotica with tau leptons with the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC](talks/2012-09-20-RReece-ChargedHiggs-SUSY-Exotics-ATLAS-CMS.pdf)*             
    *on behalf of the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations*        
    *2012/09/20*           
    A conference talk I gave reviewing the latest status of the ATLAS and CMS
    searches for charged Higgs bosons, supersymmetry, and exotica with tau leptons
    in the final state at Tau 2012: the
    [12th International Workshop on Tau Lepton Physics](http://www2.hepl.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/indico/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=0#20120920.detailed),
    Nagoya, Japan.
    
1.  *[Measurement of the W and Z boson cross sections in pp collisions at 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector](talks/2011-07-22-RReece-ATLAS-W-Z-xsec-EPS.pdf)*          
    *on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration*        
    *2011/07/22*           
    A talk I gave at the [2011 International Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics (EPS)](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/5116/contribution/533)
    in Grenoble, France.

1.  *[Likelihood functions for supersymmetric observables in frequentist analyses of the CMSSM and NUHM1](talks/2009-09-29-RReece-Likelihood-functions-for-SUSY.pdf)*       
    *2009/09/29*        
    Discussion of a paper by the same name that I lead for the Penn HEP Journal Club,
    mostly researchers in the ATLAS group.
    Most of the talk is a primer on the method of maximum likelihood and how one uses
    it to calculate confidence contours.
    While low profile, this talk is important to me because it marks the time that
    I started to understand the basics of the theory of statistical confidence intervals.


Philosophy of science talks

Here's my selected list of public talks I have given on science in general,
philosophy of science, and in particular with focuses on the
philosophy of quantum mechanics, statistics, and machine learning.
