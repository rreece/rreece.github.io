<p><strong><span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Data scientist / machine learning scientist / physicist</span></strong><br />
Palo Alto, CA</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Insight AI Fellow</strong> | January 2018 - present<br />
<a href="http://insightdata.ai/">Insight Data Science</a>, Palo Alto, CA</p>

<ul>
<li>7 week fellowship: learned about data science and machine learning applications in a variety of business domains.</li>
<li>Development of a cloud-based hyperparamter optimization platform: <a href="https://github.com/rreece/hypr-ai">HYPR.AI</a>, for automating the testing of many ML models in AWS/Paperspace containerized jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</strong> | July 2013 - August 2017<br />
<a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a>, The University of California, Santa Cruz, and<br />
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (<a href="https://home.cern/about">CERN</a>), Geneva, Switzerland</p>

<ul>
<li>I've spent 10 years, time as a postdoc and a Ph.D. student, as a member of the ATLAS experiment, a 3000+ person collaboration looking for new physics in high energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</li>
<li>LHC data has a challenging rate (~10 PB/year) and requires distributed computing for the analysis. The ATLAS codebase has more than 10 million lines of C++ and almost as many lines of Python.</li>
<li>I have become an <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">expert in petabyte data reduction</span>, high-throughput computing, world-wide grid computing, and <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">data visualization</span> as a primary user and supporter of our group's 200-CPU computing cluster, on which I have accumulated more than <a href="http://reece.scipp.ucsc.edu/share/t3_monitoring/">350k CPU-hours</a>.</li>
<li>I have played leading roles in searches for signals of supersymmetry and other exotic decays. In two such projects, I was one of two &quot;Editors&quot; that serve as the <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">management leads of a team of 5-8 analyzers</span>, eventually write the paper, and defend its approval---over a period of about a year.</li>
<li>2015-17, I moved to Geneva to be at CERN full-time to support the operations of the <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">data acquisition system (DAQ)</span> and detector monitoring systems of the SCT (a tracking sub-detector in ATLAS).</li>
<li>2017, I built more <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">expertise in machine learning techniques</span>, including deep learning frameworks and probabilistic databases. I did research into using Keras to build CNNs for particle classification, and another project using BayesDB and sklearn for <a href="https://github.com/rreece/gmm">anomaly detection</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Graduate Researcher</strong> | June 2006 - July 2013<br />
<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/atlas/">The University of Pennsylvania</a>, Philadelphia, PA, and<br />
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (<a href="https://home.cern/about">CERN</a>), Geneva, Switzerland</p>

<ul>
<li>I spent my first summers as a student with Penn (2006-08) at CERN, participating in the <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">integration and commissioning of custom electronics</span> for the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), the outermost sub-detector of the ATLAS tracker.</li>
<li>2009-12, throughout most of the running of the LHC I rotated with others the <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">on-call responsibility</span> for the TRT DAQ.</li>
<li>The focus of my Ph.D. research with the data from ATLAS has been on the identification of decays of tau leptons and their use in searches for new physics, basically a <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">pattern recognition</span> problem to identify a type of particle.</li>
<li>2009-10, I played leading roles in the development of the cut-based tau identification used with the first ATLAS data.</li>
<li>2010-12, I helped develop advanced tau identification using <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)</span> which superseded the above.</li>
<li>I have a knack for developing data analysis frameworks, of which, <a href="https://github.com/rreece/pyframe">pyframe</a> has been used by several analyses in ATLAS.</li>
<li>The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html">discovered the long-sought-after Higgs boson</a>, evidence of which was announced on the 4th of July 2012.</li>
