### *Philosophy in the Bedroom* - D.A.F. de Sade

>   All our ideas are representations of objects that strike us: what is to represent
>   to us the idea of a god, who is plainly an idea without object? Is not such an idea,
>   you will add when talking to them, quite as impossible as effects without causes?
>   Is an idea without prototype anything other than an hallucination? Some scholars,
>   you will continue, assure us that the idea of a god is innate, and that mortals 
>   already have this idea when in their mothers' bellies. But, you will remark, 
>   that is false; every principle is a judgment, every judgment the outcome of 
>   experience, and experience is only acquired by the exercise of the senses;
>   whence it follows that religious principles bear upon nothing whatever and are
>   not in the slightest innate. How, you will go on, how have they been able to
>   convince rational beings that the thing most difficult to understand is the
>   most vital to them? It is that mankind has been terrorized; it is that when
>   one is afraid one ceases to reason; it is, above all, that we have been advised
>   to mistrust reason and defy it; and that, when the brain is disturbed, one
>   believes anything and examines nothing. Ignorance and fear, you will repeat
>   to them, ignorance and fear---those are the twin bases of every religion. [^deSade2002p97]

### John Tyndall

>   The phenomena of matter and force come within our intellectual range... 
>   but behind, and above, and around us the real mystery of the universe lies 
>   unsolved, and, as far as we are concerned, is incapable of solution.... 
>   Let us lower our heads, and acknowledge our ignorance, priest and philosopher, 
>   one and all.
