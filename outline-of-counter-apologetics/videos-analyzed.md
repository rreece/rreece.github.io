### [Hitchen destroys religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuI4Nzc07Io)

Christopher Hitchens (10 mins)

The atheist proposition:

-   "It may not be said that there is no god; it may be said that there is no reason to think that there is one."
-   Even if you accept the prime mover or deist cause of the universe, you still have insurmountable work to defend theism.

Why we should be glad that it is not true:

1.  Religion is totalitarian, the wish to be a slave.
2.  Religion attacks our integrity by displacing the foundation of morality
    and claiming you cannot be know right from wrong without religion.
3.  Religion is our first version of organization, philosophy, morality, medicine, etc.
    Being our first draft, it is our worst.  We have better methods and explainations.
