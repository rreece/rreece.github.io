Commonly Overlooked Issues with the Bible
================================================================================


Old Testament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be clarified and expanded with citations:

-   Many issues with the Genesis creation myth, even with very liberal readings.
-   The Great Flood never happened.
-   The Exodus never happened.  


New Testament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also to be clarified and expanded with citations:

-   How does a cult of human sacrifice redeem anyone?
-   How does it make any sense that one deserves eternal damnation simply if they
    don't believe in the significance of a person that was tortured and killed,
    even if he claimed to be God?
