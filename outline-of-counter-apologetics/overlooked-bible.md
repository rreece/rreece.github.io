Commonly Overlooked Issues with the Bible
================================================================================


Old Testament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be clarified and expanded with citations:

-   Many issues with the Genesis creation myth, even with very liberal readings.
-   The Great Flood never happened.
-   The Exodus never happened.  


New Testament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also to be clarified and expanded with citations:

-   How does a cult of human sacrifice redeem anyone?
-   How does it make any sense that one deserves eternal damnation simply if they
    don't believe in the significance of a person that was tortured and killed,
    even if he claimed to be God?

Matthew 10:32-39 (NRSV):

>   Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven;
>   but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.
>   Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
>   For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
>   and one's foes will be members of one's own household.
>   Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;
>   and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
>   Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.
