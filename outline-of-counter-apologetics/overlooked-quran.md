>   They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, and 
>   then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until 
>   they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn their backs, take them, and 
>   slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as 
>   friend or helper.

-- [Qur'an (4:89)](http://quran.com/4/89)

>   But if they repent and establish worship and pay the 
>   poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for 
>   a people who have knowledge. And if they break their pledges after their treaty 
>   (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of 
>   disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may 
>   desist.

-- [Qur'an (9:11-12)](http://quran.com/9/11-12)

Other verses that support the demand of death for apostates are Qur'an verses 2:217, 9:73-74, 88:21, 5:54, and 9:66.
