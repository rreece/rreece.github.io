Anticipating that many believers will get overly defensive when discussing
the possibilities of the validity of their faith, let's start with some
common objections you may have to even having the conversation.

>   See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit,
>   according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the
>   universe, and not according to Christ.

-- Colossians 2:8 (RSV)

>   But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels over
>   the law, for they are unprofitable and futile.
>   As for a man who is factious, after admonishing him once or twice,
>   have nothing more to do with him.

-- Titus 3:9-10 (RSV)

Verses like the above and the sentiments they represent are door-closers,
not openers.

Note that the first verse above from Colossians could be appropriately
chanted in North Korea, replacing "Christ" with "The Dear Leader",
as a way to stifle heretical opinion.
