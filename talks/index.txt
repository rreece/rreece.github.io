    *2018/02/16, Insight Data Science, Palo Alto, CA*         
    A tutorial I gave on statistics to the other Insight AI Fellows duing my Insight fellowship.

1.  *[Diving into deep learning with keras using your ntuples](pdf/2016-10-07-RReece-Deep-Learning-Tutorial.pdf)*       
    *2016/10/07, CERN, Meyrin, Switzerland*        
    A tutorial I gave at CERN on training deep neural networks with keras,
    and preparing high-energy physics datasets for machine learning.

1.  *[pyframe](pdf/2011-09-21-RReece-pyframe-PAT.pdf)*     
    *2011/09/21, CERN, Meyrin, Switzerland*        
    An introduction to the python data selection framework I developed for
    analyzing ROOT ntuple files and has been used by several physics measurments
    and searches for new physics in the ATLAS Collaboration.

1.  *[Likelihood functions for supersymmetric observables in frequentist analyses of the CMSSM and NUHM1](pdf/2009-09-29-RReece-Likelihood-functions-for-SUSY.pdf)*       
    *2009/09/29, CERN, Meyrin, Switzerland*        
    Discussion of a paper by the same name that I lead as a graduate student
    for the Penn HEP Journal Club, mostly researchers in the ATLAS group.
    Most of the talk is a primer on the method of maximum likelihood and how one uses
    it to calculate confidence contours.
    While low profile, this talk is important to me because it marks the time that
    I started to understand the basics of the frequentist theory of statistical
    confidence intervals.


ATLAS talks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's my selected list of public talks I have given on physics with the
ATLAS experiment.

1. *[ATLAS searches for heavy Higgs bosons and supersymmetry using tau decays](pdf/2016-09-23-RReece-ATLAS-Tau-Searches-Tau2016-Beijing.pdf)*        
    *on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration*

    A conference talk I gave at
    [Tau2016: International Workshop on Tau Lepton Physics](http://tau2016.ihep.ac.cn/) in Beijing, China.
    Weak scale supersymmetry, which is one of the best motivated and studied Standard
    Model extensions, predicts that every SM particle has a partner with different spin.
    Both supersymmetry and other extensions of the Standard Model predicts the
    existence of several Higgs bosons. This talk summarizes the searches for
    supersymmetric particles and for additional heavy Higgs bosons performed
    with the ATLAS experiments at the LHC, with emphasis on those targeting final
    states with tau leptons.
    The analyses discussed use datasets corresponding to approximately 13-15/fb of
    13 TeV proton-proton collision data taken in the years 2015-2016.

    *2013/06/12, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA*         
    This talk was my Ph.D. thesis defense.
    My graduate research as a student at the University of Pennsylvania,
    working with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN,
    was on the reconstruction and identification of hadronic tau decays,
    measuring the SM *Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;* production cross section in proton-proton collisions
    at *&radic;s* = 7 TeV,
    and searching for new physics in high-mass ditau events.

Philosophy of science
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's my selected list of public talks I have given on
philosophy of science, in particular with focuses on
philosophy of quantum mechanics, statistics, and machine learning.

1.  *[Fields before particles](pdf/2017-09-24-RReece-Fields-before-particles.pdf)*       
    *2017/09/24, Lake Arrowhead, CA*                                                                        
    My talk for [California Quantum Interpretation Network (CQIN)](https://sites.google.com/site/californiaquantum/)
    where I rework the last talk I gave in Saig, defending a view that fields
    are mechanistically prior to particles.
    Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is often taken to fundamentally describe the dynamics of particles, probabilistically related to a wave function, which provides seemingly non-particle, non-local, wave-like, interference phenomena observable in quantum systems, referred to as "wave-particle duality". Since the development and maturing of quantum field theory to generalize quantum mechanics to high-energies, many attitudes about the fundamentality of particles have shifted to view them as derivative, emergent excitations in quantum fields. We review arguments for taking the field picture as more fundamental than the particle picture, while being agnostic about whatever ontology is more fundamental than fields in the case of effective field theories. We will discuss misconceptions about wave functions and wave-particle duality. We will also discuss concerns for interpreting interacting theories in light of theorems of Haag and Malament, the LSZ reduction formula, and the effects of decoherence.

1.  *[Machine learning and realism](pdf/2017-03-16-RReece-Machine-learning-and-realism.pdf)*        
    *2017/03/16, Universit&auml;t Bremen, Bremen, Germany*        
    This is a talk I gave at the
    [Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft (DPG), Bremen 2017](http://www.dpg-verhandlungen.de/year/2017/conference/bremen/part/agphil/session/5/contribution/3) meeting,
    where I argue that philosophers should be interested in developments in machine learning
    because they offer provocative ways of framing classic philosophical questions
    concerning the problem of induction, realism, and natural kinds, among others.
    Drawing on examples of uses of machine learning in particle physics,
    we introduce and discuss the following questions:
    How does the theory of statistical hypothesis testing address the problem of induction?
    How can machine learning be used in statistical inference?
    How is clustering related to natural kinds?
    Can the scientific method be automated?
    And if so, what does that imply about the objectivity of science?

1.  *[ATLAS, data reduction, and epistemology](pdf/2016-11-29-RReece-ATLAS-Epistemology.pdf)*        
    *2016/11/29, H&ouml;chstleistungsrechenzentrum Stuttgart (HLRS), Stuttgart, Germany*       
    This is a talk I was invited to give at a workshop on the philosophy
    of big data at HLRS, a high-performance computing laboratory in Stuttgart.
    I review broadly the data reduction issues for the ATLAS experiment,
    and how the theory of statistical confidence intervals is central
    to the epistemology of science.

1.  *[Fields over particles](pdf/2016-07-20-RReece-Fields-Over-Particles.pdf)*      
    *2016/07/20, Saig (Black Forest), Germany*        
    This is a talk I gave at the
    4th International Summer School in Philosophy of Physics, in Saig, Germany.
    Despite being the most empirically successful scientific theory ever developed,
    quantum mechanics has yet to yield a consensus interpretation of its foundations.
    Much of the controversy in interpreting quantum mechanics concerns the issue of
    which ingredients of the theory are more fundamental and which are derivative.
    Before reconciling debates among possible interpretations of quantum mechanics,
    it would be helpful to clarify what are the ontological commitments of the
    theory---what is quantum mechanics about?
    Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM), as it was first developed in the 1920s,
    is often taken to fundamentally describe the dynamics of particles,
    probabilistically related to a wave function, which provides seemingly non-particle,
    non-local, wave-like, interference phenomena observable in quantum systems, referred
    to as "wave-particle duality".
    Since the development and maturing of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in the following
    decades, many attitudes about the fundamentality of particles have shifted to
    view them as derivative, emergent excitations in a quantum field. In this talk,
    I review arguments for taking the field picture as more fundamental than the
    particle picture.

1.  *[How models are tested at the LHC](pdf/2015-07-21-RReece-Testing-Models-at-the-LHC.pdf)*       
    *2015/07/21, Saig (Black Forest), Germany*        
    This is a talk I gave at the
    [3rd International Summer School in Philosophy of Physics](https://sites.google.com/site/isspp2015/)
    in Saig, Germany.
    The recent discovery at the LHC of a new particle so far consistent with the
    Higgs boson has brought a warranted confirmation of the Higgs mechanism for
    electroweak symmetry breaking, but there are still many mysteries about why
    the Standard Model is the way it is. I give an introduction to the ATLAS
    experiment and a high-level overview of how the collaboration reconstructs
    and identifies final-state particles, uses detailed simulations to assist in
    modeling, and processes the data in a world-wide computing grid. Physicists
    have often lead in developing statistical theory and methods. I try to
    facilitate an appreciation for hypothesis tests and statistical confidence
    intervals, and how they are used to justify scientific claims like searches
    for new physics at the LHC.


Other outreach talks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  *[Cosmic rays, physics, and relativity](pdf/2014-07-11-RReece-Cosmic-Rays-Physics-and-Relativity-QuarkNet.pdf)*       
    *2014/07/11, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA*        
    A talk I gave at an event for [Quark Net](https://quarknet.i2u2.org/),
    a scientific outreach program that brings the inspiration and science in particle
    physics to high school students and others.
    I review how cosmic ray muons, that the students had been building detectors to count,
    are important in the history of particle physics
    and are connected to deep questions about relativity and astrophysics.
