Despite being the most empirically successful scientific theory ever developed,
quantum mechanics has yet to yield a consensus interpretation of its foundations.
Much of the controversy in interpreting quantum mechanics concerns the issue of
which ingredients of the theory are more fundamental and which are derivative.
Before reconciling debates among possible interpretations of quantum mechanics,
it would be helpful to clarify what are the ontological commitments of the
theory---What is quantum mechanics about?
