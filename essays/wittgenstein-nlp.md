Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logical positivism (also called "logical empiricism" or just "positivism")
is a philosophical movement that began in the late nineteenth century,
was further developed by the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle in the
early twentieth century, and has come to have immense influence on analytic
philosophy ever since.

>   The meaning of a word is its use in the language. [^Wittgenstein2009Sec43]

and

>   One cannot guess how a word functions.
>   One has to look at its use, and learn from that. [^Wittgenstein2009Sec340]
