October Fast Report
===============================================================================

*October 8, 2018*

Yesterday I broke my first 48 hour fast.


Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few reasons why I am interested in prolonged fasting.

1.  **To reset**

    In April, I started a new job, one where there is an exceptional amount of free food available. 

2.  **To detox**

    Cutting alcohol for the month of October

3.  **To increase insulin sensitivity**

    foo bar

4.  **To induce autophagy**

    Autophagy [^Morselli2010]

4.  **To cultivate discipline**

My schedule
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have to show up and to risk something to achieve anything.
You do not win if you do not play.
