October Fast Report
===============================================================================

*October 8, 2018*

Yesterday I broke my first 48 hour fast.


Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few reasons why I am interesting in fasting.

1.  To reset - lately eating a lot, feeling bloated.
2.  Increase insulin sensitivity
3.  Autophagy [^Morselli2010]

*The Ketogenic Bible* [^Wilson2017]

[^Wilson2017]: Wilson, J., & Lowery, R. (2017). *The Ketogenic Bible: The Authoritative Guide to Ketosis*. Simon and Schuster.
[^Morselli2010]: Morselli, E. *et al*. Caloric restriction and resveratrol promote longevity through the Sirtuin-1-dependent induction of autophagy. *Cell Death & Disease*, 1. <https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis20098>


My schedule
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have to show up and to risk something to achieve anything.
You do not win if you do not play.
