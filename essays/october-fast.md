October Fast Report
===============================================================================

*October 10, 2018*

Last weekend I did my first 48-hour fast.

I have been doing intermittent fasting all summer.
It has some real health advantages, including XXX, XXX, and XXX [^intermittent],
but that is a different story than I am reporting here.
Still, it made me want to learn more about the health effects of fasting
and interested in trying a prolonged fast of 48-72 hours.

Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few reasons why I am interested in prolonged fasting.

1.  **To reset**

    This year I started a new job, one where there is an exceptional amount of free food available. 

    We eat too often today.

2.  **To detox**

    Cutting alcohol for the month of October ([&#35;SoberOctober](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoberOctober)).
    It has great effects. [^Mehta2018]

    Not eating gives your body time to do other things.

3.  **To learn about my body**

    The hierarchy of energy sources.

    Ketones as the 4th energy macronutrient.

    *The Ketogenic Bible* [^Wilson2017]

4.  **To increase insulin sensitivity**

    Foo bar

5.  **To induce autophagy**

    Autophagy [^Levine2017] [^Royal2016]

    This reason and the previous one concerning increasing insulin sensitivity are
    primary reasons to consider doing 1-3 day fasts regularly,
    perhaps a few times a year, to increase longevity.

6.  **To cultivate discipline**

    Foo bar
